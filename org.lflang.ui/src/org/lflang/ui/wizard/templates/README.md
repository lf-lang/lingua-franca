# Templates for use in Epoch IDE
These files have a significant overlap with those in the `example` directory in the root of this repository.
We cannot link to them, because these files need to be loaded from the class path (symlinks do not work).
We can eliminate redundancies more easily once we have examples in a separate repository.
For now, we test whether these files compile with `test_templates.sh` script in this directory.
