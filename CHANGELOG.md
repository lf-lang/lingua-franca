### Runtime
- Implemented the Savina benchmark suite in the C, C++, and Rust target (modulo those that require mutations)
- Improved performance of the C++ runtime considerably

#### Python
- Multiports and banks are now iterable in the Python target ([#713](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/pull/713))

### Tool support
- Created an Language and Diagram Server that enables our new [VS Code extension](https://github.com/lf-lang/vscode-lingua-franca)
#### VS Code extension
- Generated code is now validated when an LF file is saved for all targets except C ([#828](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/pull/828)). Generated C code is only validated when it is fully compiled.

## [v0.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha) (06-04-2021)
This is a preliminary release of the Lingua Franca Compiler (`lfc`), a **command-line compiler** that translates Lingua Franca programs into target language programs, and an **Eclipse-based IDE** (integrated development environment) that provides a sophisticated editor as well as a code generator. This release supports four target languages: C, C++, Python, and Typescript. See [documentation](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki). Of the four target languages, C is the most complete. It supports all documented language features including an experimental implementation of [federated execution](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Distributed-Execution).

The IDE is suitable for the following platforms:
- Linux (`lingua-franca-rca-0.1.0-alpha-linux.gtk.x86_64.tar.gz`)
- MacOS (`lingua-franca-rca-0.1.0-alpha-macosx.cocoa.x86_64.tar.gz`)
  - **IMPORTANT NOTE**: MacOS will report that `lflang.app` is broken because it was not signed. To execute it, please run `xattr -cr lflang.app` first on the command line. Eventually, we will provide a signed download.
- Windows (`lingua-franca-rca-0.1.0-alpha-win32.x86_64.zip`)

The `lfc` command line application is suitable for:
- Linux, MacOS (`lfc-0.1.0-alpha.tar.gz`)
- Windows (`lfc-0.1.0-alpha.zip`)

#### System Requirements
- Java 11 or up ([download from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html))
- Various target-specific dependencies, documented [here](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/blob/7473ae1549c2b2aeed8f5469675f328d3984cb2c/REQUIREMENTS.md)
 
#### IDE Features
- code generation
- diagram synthesis
- error forwarding from target compiler
- validation

#### Language Features (see [language specification](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Language-Specification))
- imports
- banks
- multiports
- list-valued parameters
- target properties
- time type

#### Targets
- [C](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Writing-Reactors-in-C)
- [C++](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Writing-Reactors-in-Cpp)
