			The clone wizard can be started by clicking &quot;Click to perform&quot; below.<br /><br />
			Alternatively you can launch this wizard from the &quot;Import Projects from Git&quot; wizard using &quot;Import... &gt; Git &gt; Projects from Git &gt; Next &gt; Clone...&quot; or from the &quot;Git Repositories View&quot; using the &quot;Clone a Git Repository&quot; toolbar button.<br /><br />

		<description>
			Depending on which additional plug-ins have been installed, you may need to choose between different sources for cloning the repository.<br /><br />
			If you are not sure, choose &quot;Clone URI&quot; from the list of available sources.<br /><br />
			If the wizard is already asking your for repository details like a URI, then you can skip to the next item in the cheat sheet.

			<b>Enter the repository location.</b><br /><br />
			If you already have a <b>repository URI</b> in your clipboard, i.e. copied from a gitweb, github, wiki or any other page, it will be automatically entered into the URI field. The other fields (i.e. Host, Repository path, Protocol, Port) will then be automatically filled.<br /><br />
			In case cloning requires <b>authentication</b> (which is not the case for many repositories), enter your credentials into the User and Password fields.<br /><br />
			For a complete description of all fields as well as the supported protocols, see the referenced <b>documentation</b> (click on help icon on top of this section).<br /><br />
