abstract="This paper presents a coordination model, the Actor, Role and Coordinator (ARC) model, to address three main concerns inherent in a pervasive Open Distributed and Embedded (ODE) system: dynamicity, scalability, and stringent QoS requirements. The model treats a pervasive ODE system as a composition of concurrent computation and coerced coordination. In particular, concurrent computation is modeled as Actors, while coerced coordination specifies the system's QoS requirements by mapping them to coordination constraints. The coordination constraints are transparently imposed on actors through message manipulations, which are carried out by the roles and coordinators. The coordinators are responsible for the coordination among roles, while the roles in our model provide abstractions for coordinated behaviors that may be shared by multiple actors and further assume local coordination responsibilities for the actors playing the roles. The role's behavior abstraction decouples the syntactic dependencies between the coordinators and the actors, thus shielding the coordinator layer from the dynamicity of underlying actors inherent in ODE systems. This paper also formally defines the role and coordinator behaviors and the composition of the actor computation model with the proposed coerced coordination model. Our formal study has shown that the ARC system is closed under composition and recursion.",

    Abstract = {This paper is about reconciling the highly asynchronous untimed interactions that prevail on the Internet with time-sensitive operations of Things in the Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, this paper addresses a design pattern that is widely used on the Internet called asynchronous atomic callbacks (AAC). We show that it is possible and practical to endow AACs with temporal semantics that can make system behaviors more repeatable and testable and can make the interactions between cyber services and physical Things safer. We show how a well-defined notion of logical time is compatible with AAC and can be used to endow applications with semantic notions of simultaneity, give them more control over the ordering of events, and enable the specification of real-time behaviors that nevertheless recognize the often long and highly variable latencies introduced in the Internet. We introduce labeled logical clock domains (LLCDs), which permit arbitrary mixtures of synchronized and unsynchronized behaviors and we show how LLCDs can be realized in the JavaScript language, which is widely used in Internet applications. We give a formal model for LLCDs and an execution algorithm that is compatible with standard JavaScript engines.}

   abstract = {Designing and verifying distributed protocols in a
multi-rate asynchronous system is, in general, extremely difficult
when the distributed computations require consistent input
views, consistent actions and synchronized state transitions. In
this paper, we address this problem and introduce a formal,
complexity-reducing architectural pattern, called Multi-rate
PALS system, to support virtual synchronization in multi-rate
distributed computations. The pattern supports a component to
be virtually synchronized with other components in different
instantiations of this pattern. We present an application of
a hierarchical control system to show that the composition
of these instantiations can be used to achieve desired systemlevel
properties, such as distributed consistency and distributed
coordination. We verify the logical synchronization guarantee
of this pattern which holds as long as the pattern assumptions
are satisfied. We also discuss the correctness analysis necessary
to validate these assumptions and provide a tool support to
perform this analysis automatically on the AADL models.},

   abstract = {Program verification is a promising approach to improving program
quality, because it can search all possible program executions for
specic errors. However, the need to formally describe correct behavior
or errors is a major barrier to the widespread adoption of
program verication, since programmers historically have been reluctant
to write formal specications. Automating the process of
formulating specications would remove a barrier to program verification and enhance its practicality.
This paper describes specification mining, a machine learning
approach to discovering formal specifications of the protocols that
code must obey when interacting with an application program interface
or abstract data type. Starting from the assumption that a
working program is well enough debugged to reveal strong hints
of correct protocols, our tool infers a specification by observing
program execution and concisely summarizing the frequent interaction
patterns as state machines that capture both temporal and
data dependences. These state machines can be examined by a programmer,
to refine the specication and identify errors, and can be
utilized by automatic verication tools, to find bugs.
Our preliminary experience with the mining tool has been
promising. We were able to learn specifications that not only captured
the correct protocol, but also discovered serious bugs.},

   abstract = {We propose a new language called Precision Timed
C (PRET-C), for predictable and lightweight multi-threading
in C. PRET-C supports synchronous concurrency, preemption,
and a high-level construct for logical time. In contrast to existing
synchronous languages, PRET-C offers C-based shared memory
communications between concurrent threads that is guaranteed
to be thread safe. Due to the proposed synchronous semantics,
the mapping of logical time to physical time can be achieved
much more easily than with plain C, thanks to a Worst Case
Reaction Time (WCRT) analyzer (not presented here). Associated
to the PRET-C programming language, we present a dedicated
target architecture, called ARPRET, which combines a hardware
accelerator associated to an existing softcore processor. This
allows us to improve the throughput while preserving the predictability.
With extensive benchmarking, we then demonstrate
that ARPRET not only achieves completely predictable execution
of PRET-C programs, but also improves the throughput when
compared to the pure software execution of PRET-C. The
PRET-C software approach is also significantly more efficient
in comparison to two other light-weight concurrent C variants
(namely SC and Protothreads), as well as the well-known Esterel
synchronous programming language.},

is often critically dependent on dynamic signal processing
functionality ? i.e., signal processing functionality
in which computational structure must be dynamically
assessed and adapted based on time-varying environmental
conditions, operating constraints or application requirements.
In dynamic signal processing systems, it is important
to provide flexibility for run-time adaptation of application
behavior and execution characteristics, but in the domain
of resource-aware sensor networks, such flexibility cannot
come with significant costs in terms of power consumption
overhead or reduced predictability. In this paper, we review
a variety of complementary models of computation that are
being developed as part of the dataflow interchange format
(DIF) project to facilitate efficient and reliable implementation
of dynamic signal processing systems. We demonstrate
these methods in the context of resource-aware sensor networks.},

   abstract = {Integrating formal methods enhances their power as an intellectual tool in modelling and design. This holds regardless of automation, but a fortiori if software tools are conceived in an integrated framework.
Among the many approaches to integration, most valuable are those with the widest potential impact and least obsolescence or dependency on technology or particular tool-oriented paradigms. From a practical view, integration by unifying models leads to more uniform, wider-spectrum, yet simpler language design in automated tools for formal methods.
Hence this paper shows abstractions that cut across levels and boundaries between disciplines, help unifying the growing diversity of aspects now covered by separate formal methods and mathematical models, and even bridge the gap between continuous and discrete systems. The abstractions also yield conceptual simplification by hiding non-essential differences, avoiding repeating the same theory in different guises.
The underlying framework, not being the main topic, is outlined quite tersely, but enough for showing the preferred formalism to express and reason about the abstract paradigms of interest. Three such paradigms are presented in sufficient detail to appreciate the surprisingly wide scope of the obtained unification. The function extension paradigm is useful from signal processing to functional predicate calculus. The function tolerance paradigm spans the spectrum from analog filters to record types, relational databases and XML semantics. The coordinate space paradigm covers modelling issues ranging from transmission lines to formal semantics, stochatic processes and temporal calculi. One conclusion is that integrated formal methods are best served by calculational tools.
Keywords. Abstraction, continuous, discrete, hybrid systems, databases, filters, formal methods, function extension, function tolerance, integration, predicate calculus, quantification, semantics, signal processing, transmission lines, unification, XML.},

system components that relate input-to-output streams. We work out a hierarchy of timing
concepts. We distinguish non-timed streams, discrete streams with discrete or with continuous
time, and dense streams with continuous time. We introduce a notion of a timed system component
and formulate requirements for the time flow. We show how to compose timed systems
in a modular way. We demonstrate that the introduction of time into a system model as well
as the change of the timing model during the system development process can be captured as
classical refinement steps.},

   abstract = {Lookback is defined as the ability of a logical process to
change its past locally (without involving other logical
processes). Logical processes with lookback are able to
process out-of-timestamp order events, enabling new
synchronization protocols for the parallel discrete event
simulation. Two of such protocols, LB-GVT (LookBack-
Global Virtual Time) and LB-EIT (LookBack-Earliest
Input Time), are presented and their performance on the
Closed Queuing Network (CQN) simulation is discussed.
We show that lookback can be used to reduce the
rollback frequency in optimistic simulations. We also
discuss in detail the relation between lookahead and
lookback. Finally, we demonstrate that lookback allows
conservative simulations to circumvent the speedup limit
imposed by the critical path.},

Event Simulations. We start with traditional conservative
protocols based on lookahead and optimistic ones

process may be able to change the simulation past locally
(without involving other logical processes). This ability is
named lookback, and is a basis for a new class of PDES
synchronization protocols, named lookback-based protocols.
Another notion, impact time, is introduced to identify the
maximum amount of lookback. We also show that lookback
is always larger than or equal to lookahead, and lookbackbased
protocols can circumvent the execution time limit
imposed by the cumulative execution time of events on the
critical path on traditional conservative protocols and
optimistic protocols with no optimization.},

   abstract = {Conventional type systems specify interfaces in terms of values and domains. We present a light-weight formalism that captures the temporal aspects of software component interfaces. Specifically, we use an automata-based language to capture both input assumptions about the order in which the methods of a component are called, and output guarantees about the order in which the component calls external methods. The formalism supports automatic compatibility checks between interface models, and thus constitutes a type system for component interaction. Unlike traditional uses of automata, our formalism is based on an optimistic approach to composition, and on an alternating approach to design refinement. According to the optimistic approach, two components are compatible if there is some environment that can make them work together. According to the alternating approach, one interface refines another if it has weaker input assumptions, and stronger output guarantees. We show that these notions have game-theoretic foundations that lead to efficient algorithms for checking compatibility and refinement.},

The notion of colored tokens is used to distinguish among concurrent activations of the same dataflow procedure. The ?static-dataflow? restriction that only one token of any color can appear at one time on any arc is used throughout. A global heap is proposed to handle data structure manipulation. Actors ?select?, ?append?, and the predicate ?exists? are introduced to operate on data structures.  An ?apply? actor is used for function application.  The paper concludes with a list of open problems. The first is the ?parallel for?, which is solved by the SDF method of multiple token production.  The second is determinate procedures with memory: a problem solved with feedback loops and delays. The third is data abstraction.  The fourth is nondeterminate computation (see Arvind and Brock).},

   author = {Elmqvist, Hilding and Otter, Martin and Mattsson, Sven Erik},
   title = {Fundamentals of Synchronous Control in Modelica},
   booktitle = {International Modelica Conference},
   note = {After our conversation in Orlando last week, I went and read the attached paper to better understand what role clocks might play in handling discrete signals in FMI.  I hope this was the right thing to read. I've cc'd Hilding who can hopefully clear up any misunderstandings I have.

After reading the paper, I am more convinced than ever that Lustre and Signal-style clocks should not be part of FMI.  Discrete signals should be handled using the Esterel style instead.

Here is my reasoning:

In general, checking clock consistency is undecidable.  Consider for example an FMU "A" with a single discrete input (of type boolean, for simplicity) and a single discrete output.  Suppose that the input is associated with a periodic clock. Suppose further that the FMU produces an output event when, say, the most recent three inputs are true.  Clearly the output is discrete, but what is the relationship of its clock with the clock of the input?

Suppose further that the output of A goes to an FMU B with two inputs that requires the two inputs to have the same clock, and the other input is provided through a third FMU D as follows:

  periodic input ----->A---->|
                           |                    |B
                           |--->D---->|

Suppose D produces an output when the most recent _four_ inputs are true. The clocks are inconsistent, but what algorithm will be able to determine that?  Also, the clocks are only inconsistent for some input signals. Suppose that the periodic input comes from an FMU that produces a constant sequence of true-valued events?

Any complete declaration of the relationship between these clocks would have to expressed in a language at least as powerful as C, since that is the FMU implementation language.  The FMU becomes a white box, not a black box. And the analysis becomes undecidable. Any complete analysis would also be capable of determining the equivalence of two programs, a known undecidable question.

Since checking clock consistency is undecidable, then _any_ language we choose for FMI to express clock relationships will lead to master algorithms that must either:

1) Reject valid compositions of FMUs, or
2) Check clock relationships at run time rather than statically.

I believe that (1) is not acceptable, because it will result in one tool rejecting a composition of FMUs that is accepted by another.

Therefore, we are stuck with (2).

If we have to implement (2) anyway, then we don't really need static analysis of clocks at all.  We just need for an FMU to be able to assert error conditions. FMU B above should be able to assert an error if at any communication point, one input is present and the other is not.

I believe this leads to much simpler specification for handling discrete signals than one involving asserting clock relationships. Moreover, it is completely consistent with Modelica.  When Modelica exports an FMU, it should wrap the the code with a check of the inputs based on its own inferred clock relationships between inputs.  When importing an FMU, it should assume no relationship between output clocks and input clocks, thus falling back on the worst case, which it has to be able to handle anyway even within ordinary Modelica programs because checking clock consistency is undecidable.

Note that the attached paper defines clocks in a way so as to try to keep the problem decidable by restricting the kinds of clock constructors.  The above FMUs A and D, I believe, would have to use the following clock constructor for the output:

Clock(cond, ri0):

I can't find much discussion in the paper of this constructor. It seems intended to, for example, construct a clock associated with zero crossings.  Suppose that in the same example above, the input signal is an ordinary continuous signal instead of a boolean signal, and the two FMUs A and D do some nonlinear processing followed by a zero crossing. Then what will the relationship be between their output clocks? I believe there is no (decidable and complete) mechanism for completely defining that relationship.

Hence, any Modelica implementation that includes the above clock constructor has to be able to do run-time checking of clocks anyway... (or it must reject some valid programs). I believe it should not reject valid programs (because then Modelica ceases to be a standard: the same program may be accepted by one tool and rejected by another). Hence, any Modelica implementation that includes the above clock constructor will be able to handle the simpler FMI that we are proposing.

To state it simply, all we are proposing is that for discrete inputs to an FMU, if an input is not set by the MA at a communication point, then it is not present.  For discrete outputs of an FMU, the API needs to be extended so that the MA can determine whether an output is present, not just what its value is.  We have a concrete proposal for such an API extension, and it's a very small extension.

Our proposal is _much_ simpler than a clock relationships language. },

close to the base formalism.

Time Petri nets associate a finite enabling duration with each transition in the net. For a transition
to occur, it must have been continuously enabled for at least the minimum duration and not more than
the maximum duration.  Time Petri nets are more general than Timed Petri nets, which associate
a finite firing duration with each transition.},

   abstract = {Heterogeneous systems mix different technical domains such as signal processing, analog and digital
electronics, software, telecommunication protocols, etc. Heterogeneous systems are composed of subsystems
that are designed using different models of computation (MoC). These MoCs are the laws that govern
the interactions of the components of a subsystem. The design of heterogeneous systems includes the
design of each part of the system according to its specific MoC, and the connection of the parts in order to
build the model representing the system. Indeed, this model allows the MoCs that govern different parts
of system to coexist and interact.
To be able to use a component which is specified according to a given MoC, under other, different MoCs,
we can use either a hierarchical or a non-hierarchical approach, or we can build domain-specific components
(DSC). However, these solutions present several disadvantages. This paper presents a new model of
component, called domain-polymorph component (DPC). Such a component is atomic and is able to execute
its core behavior, specified under a given MoC, under different host MoCs. This approach is not a
competitor to the approaches above but is complementary.},

   note = {This paper seem pretty naive. It has several errors.

It talks about computations using dense models of time this way:

"Instead, normal numerical algorithms deal with rational numbers since they
can approximate real numbers".

Very few numerical algorithms deal with rational numbers. They are in fact quite expensive to compute with. Representing rational number (fully) requires two unbounded integers, one for the denominator, and one for the numerator. Adding two rational numbers requires finding the LCM of the denominators, scaling the numerators and denominators, and then adding. Reducing to a canonical form then requires factoring the numerator and denominator of the result.

What "normal numerical algorithms" use is doubles, which are not dense in the reals.

It states:

"the notions of determinism and nondeterminism are attributes of the systems being modeled or analyzed."

This is simply not true. Determinism is a property of models, not of systems being modeled (unless those systems are themselves models).

The notion of "discrete" in the paper is also naive. It puts it as opposite to dense time, but in fact these are orthogonal.},

It takes advantage of the latest developments for improving timing over Ethernet, such as IEEE 1588 (Precision Time Protocol) and Synchronous Ethernet. The presented approach aims for a general purpose, fieldbus-like transmission system, which provides deterministic data and timing (sub-ns accuracy and ps jitter) to around 1000 stations. It automatically compensates for fiber lengths in the order of 10 km. This paper describes the WR design goals and the specification used for the project. It goes on to describe the central component of the WR system structure - the WR switch - with theoretical considerations about the requirements. Finally, it presents real timing measurements for the first prototypes of WR hardware.},

   note = {Effective process networks are ones where every token produced is eventually consumed.
Local artificial deadlock is a causal cycle where at least one process is blocked on write.
They proposal to modify Parks' algorithm to detect these and increase buffer sizes on the cycle only.
This only deals with effective networks, and whether a network is effective is undecidable.
Fairness: if a process has inputs or is able to produce outputs, it is eventually executed and allowed to do so.
A maximal execution is one where execution does not stop if any process is able to run.

Kahn principle: A maximal and fair execution yields the Kahn least fixed point.

An unfortunate consequence of this is that any use of an untriggered Const actor is not
effective unless its destination consumes everything it produces.  But still, it seems that
their modified strategy will still execute this in bounded memory, and hence will not be fair.
But this is what we want, I think.

From Tom Parks:

Yes, I'm aware of this paper and another earlier one:

T. Basten and J. Hoogerbrugge. Efficient Execution of Process Networks. In A. Chalmers, M. Mirmehdi and H. Muller, editors, Communicating Process Architectures - 2001, Proceedings, pages 1-14. Bristol, UK, September 2001. IOS Press, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 2001.
http://www.ics.ele.tue.nl/~tbasten/papers/eepn.pdf

Basten et al require that a process network be both bounded and "effective" which means that every token produced is eventually consumed.  The example in your original message, and my example where process A produces a constant stream { 7, 7, 7, 7, ...} are neither bounded nor effective.  My second example where process A produces an increasing sequence { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... } is both bounded and effective. Distinguishing between these two cases essentially requires evaluation of the program and so I claim that it is intractable.

From Lefteris:

Yes, I have come across these papers. The first one actually contains a
proof why Park's algorithm doesn't converge to Kahn's least fixed point
solution. It also gives an alternative algorithm that does, but deals only
with "effective" models that I don't find general enough. The other one
offers some optimizations to Park's algorithm (along with some.. crude
heuristics) but claims that optimal scheduling (with respect to the sizes of
the buffers) is undecidable, which I think is not the case.

I think that one can argue effectively that convergence to Kahn's least
fixed point solution is not necessarily desirable. Still working on it..},

   publisher = {IEEE},
   abstract = {Cyber-physical systems interact with their physical environment. In this interaction, non-functional aspects, most notably timing, are essential to correct operation. In modern systems, dynamism is introduced in many different ways. The additional complexity threatens timely development and reliable operation. Applications often have different modes of operation with different resource requirements and different levels of required quality-of-service. Moreover, multiple applications in dynamically changing combinations share a platform and its resources. To preserve efficient development of such systems, dynamism needs to be taken into account as a primary concern, not as a verification or tuning effort after the design is done. This requires a model-driven design approach in which timing of interaction with the physical environment is taken into consid- eration; formal models capture applications and their platforms in the physical environment. Moreover, platforms with resources and resource arbitration are needed that allow for predictable and reliable behavior to be realized. Run-time management is further required to deal with dynamic use-cases and dynamic trade-offs encountered at run-time. In this paper, we present a model-driven approach that combines model-based design and synthesis with development of platforms that support predictable, repeatable, composable realizations and a run-time management approach to deal with dynamic use-cases at run-time. A formal, compositional model is used to exploit Pareto-optimal trade-offs in the system use. The approach is illustrated with dataflow mod- els with dynamic application scenarios, a predictable platform architecture and run-time resource management that determines optimal trade-offs through an efficient knapsack heuristic.},

However, while the predecessor language Giotto was purely time-triggered, xGiotto accommodates also asynchronous events. Indeed, through a mechanism called event scoping, events are the main structuring principle of the new language. The xGiotto compiler and run-time system implement event scoping through a tree-based event filter. The compiler also checks programs for determinism (absence of race conditions) and time safety (schedulability).},

In this work we propose a technique to translate designs developed with Ptolemy II, into multithreaded Java implementations on multicore platforms. We have chosen Java mainly because Ptolemy II is implemented in Java and then we get direct code reuse. The counterpart is a certain amount of overhead that we expect to be less relevant as Java runtime environment will evolve. The main goals are to produce efficient parallel simulators and software devices with competitive performance level. We show by means of an example that the first goal is easy to achieve. The application context that we are interested on is video codec design suitable for wireless networks with variable bandwidth and noise constraints. },

   note = {Collective operations are things like the MPI broadcast and gather.

Says that HPF (high-performance Fortran) and OpenMP attempt to overcome the low-level-ness
of send-receive primitives of MPI, but haven't gained traction because they make performance harder
to predict. A quick search supports this for HPF, where writing correct programs appears to be easy,
but writing efficient ones, not so easy.

"If MPI is our language of choice, then we have not just one send-receive, but
rather eight different kinds of send and two different kinds of receive. Thus,
the programmer has to choose among 16 combinations of send-receive, some
of themwith very different semantics.Of course, thismakesmessage-passing
programming very flexible, but even less comprehensible!"

Paraphrasing Dijkstra: "The various kinds and modes of send-receive used in the MPI standard,
buffered, synchronous, ready, (non-)blocking, etc., are just too primitive; they
are too much an invitation to make a mess of one?s parallel program."},
   abstract = {During the software crisis of the 1960s, Dijkstra?s famous thesis ?goto considered harmful? paved
the way for structured programming. This short communication suggests that many current difficulties
of parallel programming based on message passing are caused by poorly structured communication,
which is a consequence of using low-level send-receive primitives.We argue that, like goto
in sequential programs, send-receive should be avoided as far as possible and replaced by collective
operations in the setting of message passing. We dispute some widely held opinions about the
apparent superiority of pairwise communication over collective communication and present substantial
theoretical and empirical evidence to the contrary in the context of MPI (Message Passing
Interface).},

An algebra is a collection of function names, a set, and an interpretation of application of the functions to members of the set. A function of arity zero (called a distinguished element) is used to denote constants. An evolving algebra permits functions to be redefined. A state is a current algebra, and a set of guarded updates is executed (all concurrently). Contradictions in the update are interpreted as nondeterministic choices (whether contradictions exist is undecidable). The concurrency semantics seems to be synchronous/reactive, but this is by no means made clear. Concurrency is not an emphasis, and in fact, some of the examples will not work as explained unless one takes a sequential interpretation to the updates. Inputs are modeled by ?external functions? which change their definition in each state independent of the action of the program. Examples given include a stack machine, a Turing machine, and the ?strcpy? function in the C library. An extension to concurrent machines (described in another paper) apparently uses multiple asynchronous evolving algebras. Seems that this would increase nondeterminacy problems.},

"The paper gives an overview of our approach which is very close to  
the approach developed in Ptolemy. The main differences are:
  - the execution algorithm is decomposed into smaller operations  
than in Ptolemy
  - the validation of an observation is an operation of the general  
algorithm (it exists in CT only in Ptolemy)
  - components can give constraints on the time stamp of they next  
observation (similar to self-posted events in DE)
  - the semantic adaptation between MoCs is defined explicitly in  
the models (through InterfaceBlocks) which play the same role as  
Ptolemy Classic WormHoles, but are part of the model, not of the  
framework."

The paper has a notion of snapshots of the model, taken at times
that each component can specify (this sounds like fireAt(), but
the authors claim it differs from Ptolemy "where the root model
drives the execution of the other layers of the hierarchy."

   title = {A ModularWorst-case Execution Time Analysis Tool for {Java} Processors},
   booktitle = {RTAS - submitted},
   note = {Authors are from Irvine and Vienna.

Describes an open-source tool suite called Volta that provides
quick static analysis techniques to support interactive WCET analysis
for Java programs running on Java processors. Focuses on JOP, apparently
developed by the authors, in part due to the possibility of a simple model for
the instruction cache. Integrates with JEDIT and uses graphviz to provide
visualization of the static analysis.

Volta has two separated key components, Cascade, which provides flow
analysis based on the JODE decompiler. It exports very readable control
flow diagrams.

A separate WCET analysis tool called Clepsydra uses the results of Cascade
to do path analysis and execution time modeling using a processor model
to come up with WCET estimates. Instruction timing estimation is simplified
considerably by assuming a Java processor target like JOP.

These tools are built for extensibility and adaptibility, for example using the
Strategy pattern in Clepsydra.

Results on benchmarks range from 0% to 1700% pessimism, which is not
that impressive even for WCET analysis results, but the authors creditably
chose a benchmark suite well that includes some particularly difficult code
for static analysis of WCET.

Has a nice argument for Java processors based on "easier certification".},

   abstract = {We present an algorithm called TAR ("Thread-modular Abstraction Refinement") for model checking safety properties of concurrent software. The TAR algorithm uses thread-modular assume-guarantee reasoning to overcome the exponential complexity in the control state of multithreaded programs. Thread modularity means that TAR explores the state space of one thread at a time, making assumptions about how the environment can interfere. The TAR algorithm uses counterexample-guided predicate-abstraction refinement to overcome the usually infinite complexity in the data state of C programs. A successive approximation scheme automatically infers the necessary precision on data variables as well as suitable environment assumptions. The scheme is novel in that transition relations are approximated from above, while at the same time environment assumptions are approximated from below. In our software verification tool Blast we have implemented a fully automatic race checker for multithreaded C programs which is based on the TAR algorithm. This tool has verified a wide variety of commonly used locking idioms, including locking schemes that are not amenable to existing dynamic and static race checkers such as Eraser or Warlock.},

We introduce the concept of lazy abstraction to integrate and optimize the three phases of the abstract-check-refine loop. Lazy abstraction continuously builds and refines a single abstract model on demand, driven by the model checker, so that different parts of the model may exhibit different degrees of precision, namely just enough to verify the desired property. We present an algorithm for model checking safety properties using lazy abstraction and describe an implementation of the algorithm applied to C programs.

This paper tries to demystify the benefits of OOP. We point out that, as with so many previous software engineering fads, the biggest gains in using OOP result from applying principles that are older than, and largely independent of, OOP. Moreover, many of the claimed benefits are either not true or true only by chance, while occasioning some high costs that are rarely discussed. Most seriously, all the hype is preventing progress in tackling problems that are both more important and harder: control of parallel and distributed applications, GUI design and implementation, fault tolerant and real-time programming. OOP has little to offer these areas. Fundamentally, you get good software by thinking about it, designing it well, implementing it carefully, and testing it intelligently, not by mindlessly using an expensive mechanical process.},

   note = {Discusses some of the semantics of the model developed into a language in Kahn/MacQueen. Sequential processes communicate through channels using only non-blocking writes and blocking reads. Kahn argues that if the actors (processes) are ?continuous? (continuity is over a set of ordered lists of data tokens with a partial order (prefix order) relationship between them), then they are also monotone, and any composition of such processes, including recursive combinations and feedback loops, is determinate. Monotone means that if input X1 produces output Y1 and input X2 produces output Y2, then if X1 is a prefix of X2, then Y1 will be a prefix of Y2. It is a form of causality, but without invoking time.
A combination of such processes is described as a set of equations over sequences, and a solution to the equations (a fixed point) gives a possible trace for the processes. Kahn argues (but does not prove) that continuity implies that there will be exactly one ?minimal? solution (where minimal is in the sense of prefix ordering). The minimal solution results from null sequences at the inputs. Other solutions can then be found by iterative compuation, which works because of the monotone condition.
The overall objective appears to be to be able to prove that a given program has a given behavior. A very simple example of such a proof is given.},

   note = {This paper talks about a model of computation in which ?channels? enable communication between ?processes?. Inputs and outputs to a process are distinguished from parameters, which have a more functional style. When a process accesses data from a port, if no data is available, the process suspends. A demand-driven style of computation is proposed in which a single ?driver? process (one with no output ports) demands inputs. When it suspends due to an input being unavailable, the channel is marked ?hungry? and the source process is activated. It may in turn suspend, if its inputs are not available. Any process that issues a PUT command to a hungry channel will be suspended and the destination process restarted where it left off. If a GET operation suspends a process, and the source process is already suspended waiting for an input, then deadlock has been detected. It is an important part of the semantics of the language that the availability of inputs cannot be tested. The network may be specified either by giving channels names and binding them to inputs and outputs of processes, or by using a functional notation for processes with only a single output.
Reconfiguration of the network on the fly is allowed. This allows for recursive definition of processes. Recursive defnition of streams (data) is also permitted in the form of directed loops in the process graph.

A program is said to be determinate if the history of every communication variable (stream) is determined by the value of the program?s parameters. Determinacy is guaranteed as long as each channel is bound to a single output port of a single producer.
Imperative ordering of operations within a process definition is allowed, so the language mixes functional, imperative, and dataflow semantics all in one.

Two very interesting examples are given. The first recursively specifies an algorithm for finding prime numbers using the sieve of Eratosthenes. The second uses data recurrences and an ordered merge to compute an ordered sequence of integers of the form  for all . This latter problem had been considered by Dijkstra.},

   volume = {14},
   pages = {1390-1411},
   note = {This is the earliest apparent work with the synchronous dataflow model. The computation graphs used here are more general than SDF, because they allow thresholds to be different from the number of samples consumed. In either case, they are a special case of Petri Nets and the P/V systems of Dijkstra. The nodes in the graph are single-valued functions of the inputs, so proving determinacy is easy. Determinacy is simply that (1) the number of firings of each node is the same in all proper executions of the graph, and (2) that the data sequence on each arc depends only on the initial data on the arcs. A ?proper execution? is a fair execution. An ?execution? is a sequence of (possibly simultaneous) node initiations such that whenever a node is fired its input thresholds have all been satisfied, and when the execution terminates, no node is enabled. When any execution is finite, then all executions are finite, and all are proper. Any graph with source nodes has only infinite executions. The paper considers conditions under which a computation graph terminates. Specifically, if a set of inequalities relating the number of firings of each actor has a finite, non-negative, integer solution, then every execution terminates. In a strongly connected subgraph, either all nodes have finite firings, or all have inifinite firings. Within strongly connected subgraphs, it is enough to consider loops. Any loop with a total gain less than 1 self-terminates, where the gain of an arc is the ratio of the number of tokens produced to the number consumed. A necessary, but not sufficient condition for a loop with unity gain to terminate is given. For such loops, the balance equations solution is given (although the balance equations themselves are not mentioned or considered). It is pointed out that if such a loop self-terminates, then the number of executions of at least one of the actors in the loop must be less than the number dictated by the smallest integer solution to the balance equations. It is proven that a homogeneous loop terminates iff there are no delays on it. An algorithm is then given to identify the nodes in a computation graph that terminate. Queue lengths are considered, and it is shown that any nonterminating computation graph in which each queue length is uniformly bounded must be strongly connected, and each loop in it must have unity gain (here is, essentially, the balance equation concept, though it misses the point that bounded queues can be ensured with periodic execution regardless of whether the graph is strongly connected).
The notion of and ?iteration? in an execution is similar to that used later by Culler. They form an execution of a graph from sets of node firings.  Because you can only test membership for a set, there can be only 0 or 1 firings of a node in a set.  The execution of a graph is made up of sequences of these sets.},

   publisher = {Morgan Claypool Publishers},
   series = {Synthesis Lectures on Computer Science},
   note = {Timed I/O automata (TIOA) are special cases of Hybrid I/O automata [superLynch 96] (HIOA),
which add timed behavior to I/O automata. HIOA may have external variables that evolve
continously, in addition to state variables, whereas in TIOA, continuous transformation
is limited to internal system components that determine the timing of events (this is
analogous to the relationship between timed automata and hybrid systems, where
the continuous dynamics of TA is only the passage of time).
Components have input "actions" (state
transitions), and internal actions, some of which "control" output actions. There is no
notion of input or output ports, so presumably the order of input actions is entirely
externally controlled. Components are always input enabled, meaning that in every
state, there is a reaction to any input action.  Also, behaviors are prefix closed,
meaning that if a component can produce a trajectory (an alternating sequence
of states and actions), then it can also produce any prefix of that trajectory.
Analysis is based mainly on state machine concepts, implementation and simulation.
This is a much more operational view than, say, metric-space approaches to
timed systems or Liu-style.
As presented, they don't handle superdense time, but probably could be extended.
There is a prefix-order semantics given. Variables have a value at all times,
and have a "static type" (the data type at each time), and a "dynamic type"
(constraints on how the variable can evolve in time). A dynamic type is required
to be closed under time shift (if a particular function of time is in the type,
then any time-shifted version of it is in the type), closed under subintervals
(can subset the domain to any left-closed subset of time), and closed
under pasting (can stitch together time-bounded functions). In the latter
case, since superdense time is not supported, at the boundary between
time intervals, the value is given by the left section, so "analog signals"
are continuous from the left.  Hybrid sequences alternate between discrete
state transitions and continuous evolution of variables (as in ideal solver semantics).

In Timed Automata (vs. Timed I/O Automata), actions are external or internal, but
external actions are not further classified as input or output. Axioms include
suffix closure and concontenation closure that allow composition where an action
of a possibly unrelated automaton can interrupt a trajectory.

A number of examples, including timeout, Fischer's mutual exclusion algorithm, periodic
sending processes, and clock synchronization are given.

The "implementation" relation is a trace inclusion relation. A "simulation" relation is
a relation on the states. Theorems relation simulation and implementation in the
standard way.

Timed I/O automata extend by partitioning external actions into input and output
actions, assuming that every component is input action enabled, and "time passage
enabled" (meaning that in every state, either time can go to infinity, or the trajectory
is closed (bounded) and ends with a locally-controlled output action.},

simulation over and over, and finally taking the maximum time

   note = {TLA is a logic about sequences of states. Actions are state transitions,
given as a conjunction of predicates.  A sequence of actions changes the
value of a set of variables, indicated by predicates like x' = \not x.  The
key expression is \Box [N]_v, where N is an action and v a tuple of variables.
It means that every step is either an N action or leaves all the variables in v
unchanged. A system specication will be a formula that is a conjunction
of a predicate defining initial conditions and \Box[N]_v, typically.
Type correctness is given by \Box T, where T is a conjunction
of predicates declaring types of variables (membership in suitable sets).
You can prove type correctness by proving the system implies \Box T.
A behavior is a sequence of states (variable assignments) satisfying a formula.

A property is a set of behaviors that is invariant under stuttering, meaning that the
set contains a behavior b iff it contains every behavior obtained from b by
adding or removing stuttering steps.
A safety property is a formula that is satisfied by an infinite behavior iff it is
satisfied by every finite prefix of the behavior. Anything of the form  \Box [N]_v
is a safety property. A conjunction of safety properties is a safety property.
Safety properties allow behaviors that stop changing.

Fairness properties prohibit behaviors that stop changing. Weak fairness
WF_v(N) asserts that if action N is enabled forever (its predicates can be satisfied
by suitable choices of primed variables, like x'), then infinitely many N steps occur.
Strong fairness SF_v(N) asserts that if N is enabled infinitely often, then
infinitely many N steps occur. Together these imply liveness, in the sense of
Alpern and Schneider.

Whereas [N]_v means either action N is taken or v is unchanged, 
\langle N \rangle_v means that N is taken and v is changed.

Eventually is written \Diamond, and satisifies

     \Diamond F \triangleeq \not \Box \not F

for a formula F. It means F is eventually true. The fairness properties
can be written using this as follows:

  WF_v(N) \triangleeq \Box \Diamond \not (Enabled \langle N \rangle_v)
                                      \vee \Box \Diamond \langle N \rangle_v
  SF_v(N) \triangleeq \Diamond \Box \not (Enabled \langle N \rangle_v)
                                      \vee \Box \Diamond \langle N \rangle_v

meaning that either it is always true that N is eventually taken (for both
cases) or (for WF) it is always true that eventually N is not enabled or
(for SF) it is eventually true that N is never again enabled. The closure
C(F) of a property F is the smallest safety property containing F.
For any property F, C(F) can be expressed by a TLA formula.

Given a safety property F and another arbitrary property L, (F,L) is
machine closed iff every finite behavior satisfying F can be extended
to an infinite behavior in F \wedge L.  Equivalently, (F,L) is machine
closed if C(F \wedge L) = F.  Equivalently, for any safety property
P, if F \wedge L implies P, then F implies P.
The lack of machine closure can be
a source of incompleteness for proof methods. That is, you may
be able to prove F implies P but not F \wedge L implies P. But the
latter may hold even if the former does not.},

   journal = {ACM Transactions on Computer Systems},
   volume = {16},
   number = {2},
   pages = {133-169},
   note = {Also appeared as SRC Research Report 49.  This paper was first submitted in 1990, setting a personal record for publication delay.

A fault-tolerant file system called Echo was built at SRC in the late 80s.  The builders claimed that it would maintain consistency despite any number of non-Byzantine faults, and would make progress if any majority of the processors were working.  As with most such systems, it was quite simple when nothing went wrong, but had a complicated algorithm for handling failures based on taking care of all the cases that the implementers could think of.  I decided that what they were trying to do was impossible, and set out to prove it.  Instead, I discovered the Paxos algorithm, described in this paper.  At the heart of the algorithm is a three-phase consensus protocol.  Dale Skeen seems to have been the first to have recognized the need for a three-phase protocol to avoid blocking in the presence of an arbitrary single failure.  However, to my knowledge, Paxos contains the first three-phase commit algorithm that is a real algorithm, with a clearly stated correctness condition and a proof of correctness.  
I thought, and still think, that Paxos is an important algorithm.  Inspired by my success at popularizing the consensus problem by describing it with Byzantine generals, I decided to cast the algorithm in terms of a parliament on an ancient Greek island.  Leo Guibas suggested the name Paxos for the island.  I gave the Greek legislators the names of computer scientists working in the field, transliterated with Guibas's help into a bogus Greek dialect.  (Peter Ladkin suggested the title.)  Writing about a lost civilization allowed me to eliminate uninteresting details and indicate generalizations by saying that some details of the parliamentary protocol had been lost.  To carry the image further, I gave a few lectures in the persona of an Indiana-Jones-style archaeologist, replete with Stetson hat and hip flask.  

My attempt at inserting some humor into the subject was a dismal failure.  People who attended my lecture remembered Indiana Jones, but not the algorithm.  People reading the paper apparently got so distracted by the Greek parable that they didn't understand the algorithm.  Among the people I sent the paper to, and who claimed to have read it, were Nancy Lynch, Vassos Hadzilacos, and Phil Bernstein.  A couple of months later I emailed them the following question: 

Can you implement a distributed database that can tolerate the failure of any number of its processes (possibly all of them) without losing consistency, and that will resume normal behavior when more than half the processes are again working properly? 

None of them noticed any connection between this question and the Paxos algorithm.  
I submitted the paper to TOCS in 1990.  All three referees said that the paper was mildly interesting, though not very important, but that all the Paxos stuff had to be removed.  I was quite annoyed at how humorless everyone working in the field seemed to be, so I did nothing with the paper.  A number of years later, a couple of people at SRC needed algorithms for distributed systems they were building, and Paxos provided just what they needed.  I gave them the paper to read and they had no problem with it.  So, I thought that maybe the time had come to try publishing it again.  

Meanwhile, the one exception in this dismal tale was Butler Lampson, who immediately understood the algorithm's significance.  He mentioned it in lectures and in a paper, and he interested Nancy Lynch in it.  De Prisco, Lynch, and Lampson published their version of a specification and proof.  Their papers made it more obvious that it was time for me to publish my paper.  So, I proposed to Ken Birman, who was then the editor of TOCS, that he publish it.  He suggested revising it, perhaps adding a TLA specification of the algorithm.  But rereading the paper convinced me that the description and proof of the algorithm, while not what I would write today, was precise and rigorous enough.  Admittedly, the paper needed revision to take into account the work that had been published in the intervening years.  As a way of both carrying on the joke and saving myself work, I suggested that instead of my writing a revision, it be published as a recently rediscovered manuscript, with annotations by Keith Marzullo.  Marzullo was willing, Birman agreed, and the paper finally appeared.  

There was an amusing typesetting footnote to this.  To set off Marzullo's annotations, I decided that they should be printed on a gray background.  ACM had recently acquired some wonderful new typesetting software, and TOCS was not accepting camera-ready copy.  Unfortunately, their wonderful new software could not do shading.  So, I had to provide camera-ready copy for the shaded text.  Moreover, their brilliant software could accept this copy only in floating figures, so Marzullo's annotations don't appear quite where they should.  Furthermore, their undoubtedly expensive software wasn't up to typesetting serious math.  (After all, it's a computing journal, so why should they have to typeset formulas?) Therefore, I had to provide the camera-ready copy for the definitions of the invariants in section A2, which they inserted as Figure 3 in the published version.  So, the fonts in that figure don't match those in the rest of the paper.},

   abstract = {Many operating system designs can be placed into one of two very rough categories, 
depending upon how they implement and use the notions of process and 
synchronization. One category, the "Message-oriented System," is characterized by a 
relatively small, static number of processes with an explicit message system for 
communicating among them. The other category, the "Procedure-oriented System," is 
characterized by a large, rapidly changing number of small processes and a process 
synchronization mechanism based on shared data. 
In this paper, it is demonstrated that these two categories are duals of each other and 
that a system which is constructed according to one model has a direct counterpart in 
the other. The principal conclusion is that neither model is inherently preferable, and the 
main consideration for choosing between them is the nature of the machine architecture 
upon which the system is being built, not the application which the system will ultimately 
support. },

It argues that to realize its full potential, the core abstractions of computing need to be rethought to incorporate essential properties of the physical systems, most particularly the passage of time. It makes a case that the solution cannot be simply overlaid on existing abstractions, and outlines a number of promising approaches being pursued. The emphasis needs to be on repeatable behavior rather than on performance optimization.},

   pages = {85-95},
   abstract = {Composed of tens of thousands of tiny devices with very
limited resources ("motes"), sensor networks are subject to
novel systems problems and constraints. The large number
of motes in a sensor network means that there will often
be some failing nodes; networks must be easy to repopu-
late. Often there is no feasible method to recharge motes,
so energy is a precious resource. Once deployed, a network
must be reprogrammable although physically unreachable,
and this reprogramming can be a significant energy cost.
We present Mate', a tiny communication-centric virtual
machine designed for sensor networks. Mate's high-level in-
terface allows complex programs to be very short (under
100 bytes), reducing the energy cost of transmitting new
programs. Code is broken up into small capsules of 24
instructions, which can self-replicate through the network.
Packet sending and reception capsules enable the deploy-
ment of ad-hoc routing and data aggregation algorithms.
Mat~'s concise, high-level program representation simplifies
programming and allows large networks to be frequently re-
programmed in an energy-efficient manner; in addition, its
safe execution environment suggests a use of virtual ma-
chines to provide the user/kernel boundary on motes that
have no hardware protection mechanisms.},

the continued analysis of infeasible paths [13]. They were also able to
extend their ILP model to incorporate instruction cache behavior, by
dividing the program into cache-line sized segments and ascribing
annotations to each block indicating misses and hits and conflicts
with other blocks. Many of these methods provide means for the
user to include their own constraints in an attempt to try to bound
the estimates more effectively." (this one is [13])},

Components are synchronous to a clock, and multiple asynchronous clocks can be combined (see Meng, non-isochronous).  The multiple clocks are scheduled using an event queue. Cycle-driven simulation is used within each clock. Each component is a thread with an entry() method that is executed in an infinite loop (and may itself contain an infinite loop). A call to wait() synchronizes to the next clock edge (the clock is specified as a constructor argument). Components can be reactive by waiting and watching for signal conditions. A component can also wait\_until(some event), where the event is specified by giving an unevaluated closure.  This is done cleverly using operator overloading. E.g.:

   wait\_until(start == '1');

where "start" is a signal and "==" is overloaded.
Either wait() or wait_until() may throw an exception to indicate a preemption, such as a reset. To set this up, do something like this:

  watching( reset == '1');

where "reset" is a signal.  This adds a closure to the "watch list" for the process, and results in an exception being thrown in wait() or wait_until() when the closure evaluates to true (checked on every clock edge).},

system that makes an entire sensor network act as a single unified

and dynamically finds a good (i.e. energy efficient in our case, but
we are thinking about other metrics as well) placement of those
components on the network nodes.

The high bit is that raising the level of abstraction is
good for three reasons: 
     - makes the network easier to program,
     - provides a greater degree of freedom to the OS because the
       application semantics are explicit to the lower layers,
     - enables the OS to make better decisions about global resource

The scope of effects are represented by regions, which abstract a set of memory locations
in which side-effects may occur. The effects of expressions can be
inferred using techniques similar to the one used in the ML type system, with extensions.
One application of effect analysis is in parallel computers. If two expressions
have interfering effects, then a compiler can schedule them in parallel. Effect

   note = {The original paper on I/O automata. The paper argues forcefully that CCS and CSP
do not adequately describe control because when two processes engage in an action,
neither process controls the performance of the action. I/O automata add the notion
of input and output to CSP and CCS. It is a similar rendezvous-based MoC, with the
difference that a process is able to accept any input action at any time. That is, all
input actions are enabled in all every state. Thus, a very strong distinction is made
between the actions controlled by a process (its output actions), and those not 
controlled by it (its input actions). Every process is a state machine, and the composition
is the product machine. Output actions of a composition must be disjoint. Internal
actions of each automanton in the composition must be disjoint from all actions of
other automata.  A system is fair if every system component is eventually given the
chance to take a computational step.

This is not quite the MoC of the rendezvous domain because we don't have
every input action enabled in every state. In fact, wouldn't that be more like a
nondeterminate dataflow model, where arrival of any input triggers a firing?
The default reaction, I suppose, is stuttering.

The paper talks about proving properties based on a notion of "simulation" that
is actually behavior containment. Uses this to "prove correctness" of Schonhage's
distributed arbiter.},

is an intrinsically asynchronous language (PN-like). Constraints are given on relative

   note = {Key idea is to augment actors (which have data ports for streaming data) with "control ports"
which are provides/requires ports that provide functionality like fire(), attributeChanged(),
fireAt(), etc. The director provides similar interfaces.

Review of the journal submission version:

This paper describes "42," a formalism for describing compositions of
components and their execution. I recommend accepting the paper after somewhat
major revisions. In "42", components have input and output ports for data, and
input and output ports for control. The control ports interact with a
controller.

The approach is inspired by Ptolemy, where the authors set out to formalize the
interaction of components. However, the distinction between 42 and Ptolemy
directors is not made clear in the paper. Specifically, the controller gives
the execution policy for a _particular_ composition of components; note that
this is not quite like a Ptolemy director, which gives the execution policy for
a _family_ of compositions of components. In 42, the controller is specific to
a particular composition of particular components. This is much more limited
than a Ptolemy director. Is the intent that controllers are defined by hand?
This seems unfortunate. Presumably, one could create a Ptolemy director that
synthesizes a 42 controller for a particular MoCC. The code generators in
Ptolemy in Ptolemy II do essentially this, although the controllers they
synthesize are in the host language (C++, Java, C, VHDL, etc.) rather than in a
specialized controller language.

Behavioral properties of components are given by protocols, which are finite
state machines annotated with 42-specific guards and actions on transitions.
There is a good bit of discussion in the paper about compatibility of
protocols and controllers, but the paper actually fails to formalize this
interaction.  Just giving the interaction a notation does not really constitute
a useful formalization. One would also need to be able to formally check
compatibility. The paper does not describe any method for doing that.
Note that the Ptolemy Project has done that.  See:

   Lee and Xiong, A Behavioral Type System and Its Application
   in Ptolemy II, in Formal Aspects of Computing, Volume 16, Number 3, August
   2004.

On p. 10, the authors state that the controller associates a bounded FIFO
queue with each wire. This seems rather inelegant. A bounded FIFO queue
adds nothing in expressiveness over a simple variable, and stops short
of sufficient expressiveness for Kahn networks, which require unbounded
queues.

It is not clear in the paper that 42 can actually specify Kahn semantics, as
claimed. In section 2.4.1, the authors state that a component should specify
which inputs are needed for each control input. But in section 3.1, components
in a Kahn network are given a single control input, which is insufficient. The
example in section 3.1 is too trivial to illustrate the insufficiency, since
all components require all inputs on all activations. This is not an
interesting Kahn network. If you create a component that sometimes requires
inputs on one input port, and sometimes requires inputs on another input port,
then the mechanism from section 2.4.1 is insufficient. The answer here is
undoubtedly a protocol required for each component that reflects whether it
needs data on each input for each activation. The key question then becomes: If
the protocol is constrained to be an FSM, then isn't the model less expressive
than Kahn networks?

This question becomes clearer if you consider the example in figures 6,7,8;
what if there is an activation of the composite (action go) that does not
require an input at i? There seems to be no way to express this, which would
make this formalism fall short of the expressiveness of Kahn networks (it would
be easy to give an example that deadlocks with the paper's formalism but does
not deadlock in a true Kahn network).  Regrettably, the fix for this is
probably a manually-written protocol for the composite that requires deep
understanding of the composite. That protocol is not the same as the one
governing invocations of P1 because an invocation of the composite does not
necessarily map to exactly one invocation of P1. I speculate, in fact, that for
full Kahn network semantics, the protocol must not be constrained to be a
finite state machine. The paper hints at inadequacy in the protocol language
in section 3.3.1.1, where it states "We should then use a protocol language
allowing more easy to-use data structures like FIFOs."

In addition to Kahn networks, there are other MoCCs where 42 appears to be
inadequate. The paper correctly observes that continuous-time models fall
in this category. I conjecture that so do discrete-event models (as in DEVS,
Opnet, ns2, VHDL, etc.). These models require that the controller maintain
an event queue, which is not a finite state structure. Constraining it
to finite state fundamentally would limit expressiveness. On the other hand,
I conjecture that rendezvous MoCCs like CSP and CCS are probably representable.

The paper suggests that several rather ad-hoc extensions are needed for
practical usage.  In section 2.4.3, "A component may specify that it is ready
to deal with new inputs or, conversely, that he would like to keep the same
inputs as last time it was activated."  In section 3.2.5, "In this case, each
component has to specify the dependency between its outputs and its inputs, and
each component has to be equipped with a go activation, and one geto activation
per data output." No notation is given for these extensions, and no indication
of what the implications might be on any formal analysis applied to 42 models.
These seem like rather ad hoc extensions.

The paper is much longer than is really justified. The applications
showing transaction-level architectures could be greatly simplified
without any real loss of content. Much of the discussion is wordy and
repetitive. Comparisons to more distant related work (such as Corba)
are rather superficial, and, as written, add little to the paper.

In summary, my opinion is that the paper describes good work and a
useful perspective on component architectures, but could use another
pass to improve the discussion of closely related work, to be clear
about the limitations of the current work, to address the questions above
about expressiveness, and to shorten the paper.

Minor comments:

- On p.4, the authors talk about "pure dataflow" giving as examples
  Simulink, Lustre/SCADE, and Signal. Many readers, however, will
  associate the term "dataflow" with Jack Dennis and dataflow machines,
  and with Gilles Kahn and process networks. Those dataflow models
  are very different from Simulink, Lustre/SCADE, and Signal.

- On p.4, the authors state that in Ptolemy, "components are actors
  in the sense of [24]." This isn't quite true, since [24] gives a
  rather specific MoCC.  It was later that the term "actors" acquired
  a more general meaning.

- On p.4, the authors state that in Ptolemy "it is possible to consider
  it, [sic] either as a dataflow diagram or as an automaton, just by
  changing the MoCCs." This isn't quite true either, any more than an
  ASCII file containing text can be considered to be a Java program or
  a C++ program, just by changing the filename extension. Most models
  in Ptolemy are designed to work in a particular MoCC, and it makes
  little sense to change the MoCC later. It is occasionally possible
  to do so because components can be defined to be "domain polymorphic."
  Analogously, the "+" operator is "language polymorphic".  The ASCII text
 "int x = 10 + 5;" is valid Java program and valid C++, but most text
  files will not be valid in both languages.  The point of Ptolemy's
  domain polymorphism is that components (including composites) can
  often be used within multiple MoCCs, thus greatly increasing the utility
  of a component library. The same is true of composite components in
  42.},

This paper studies the problem of deadlock and livelock in Kahn process networks.
Mathews is most interested whether signals are infinite (which he calls "complete")
and he develops a generalization of the Cantor metric (which he calls the Baire metric,
see de Bakker and de Vink). The key is to define a partial metric, where the distance
of a sequence to itself is greater than zero if the sequence is finite, and is zero only
if the sequence is infinite. He then develops a generalization of the Banach fixed point
theorem to partial metrics and shows that if you have a contraction, then the fixed
point is "complete" (has Baire distance 0 to itself).  Thus, the question being addressed
here is whether the least fixed point semantics yields an infinite sequence. Note that
Mathews theorem is not constructive, though I suspect it could be made so.},

   note = {Like the paper by Pratt, which refers to this, Mazurkiewicz generalizes string languages to be partially ordered, gives a theory of traces to facilitate formal reasoning, and uses dependence graphs as graphical representations of traces. The paper is a bit obsessed with showing that everything is a monoid, but nonetheless has some interesting techniques.
A monoid is an algebra with one associative operation (dot), (the composition operation), and one constant e (the neutral element in composition).  An element a of a monoid is an atom if it is not neutral and a=b.c implies that b or c is neutral. I.e., it cannot be given as a composition with anything except a neutral.
An event domain is defined to consist of objects and events, where the events are changes of state of the objects. Events associated with an object are totally ordered, like the events in processes in Lamport?s model. It is assumed that in all observations, the ordering of events is linear, but different observers might observe different orderings. Events are independent of such differences in ordering are possible. Histories are orderings of events associated with an object. Monotonicity and fixed points are also considered.
For any two relations R,Q, the composition xRQy is s.t. there is a z s.t. xRzQy. Given this, we can define a transitive closure R* of a relation. An ordering relationship R is ?discrete? if R=(R-RR)*. The right hand side can be understood as an ordering relation where there is no intervening item (i.e., apply once). In a non-discrete ordering, I would guess that R-RR would be the empty set, since any two ordered items would always have an intervening item.},

   abstract = {Many Distributed Real-Time Systems (DRTS), such as integrated
modular avionics systems and distributed control systems in
motor vehicles, are made up of a collection of components that communicate
asynchronously and that must change their state and respond to
environment inputs within hard real-time bounds. Such systems are often
safety-critical and need to be certified; but their certification is currently
very hard due to their distributed nature. The Physically Asynchronous
Logically Synchronous (PALS) architectural pattern can greatly reduce
the design and verification complexities of achieving virtual synchrony in
a DRTS. This work presents a formal specification of PALS as a formal
model transformation that maps a synchronous design, together with
performance bounds of the underlying infrastructure, to a formal DRTS
specification that is semantically equivalent to the synchronous design.
This semantic equivalence is proved, showing that the formal verification
of temporal logic properties of the DRTS can be reduced to their verification
on the much simpler synchronous design. An avionics system case
study illustrates the usefulness of PALS for formal verification purposes.},

fixed point is the same as the common prefix of that any signal s with F(s), where F is the system function.

Also gives an alternative formulation where signals are defined on downsets and shows that for total signals,
the definition is the same. In this latter case, he just needs monotonicity and Knaster-Tarski to conclude that there is a fixed
point, but there may be more than one fixed point, and the fixed point is not necessarily total. },

implementation is one of the critical challenges for
embedded software systems. In the context of embedded
control systems that interact with an environment, a variety
of errors due to quantization, delays, and scheduling
policies may generate executable code that does not faithfully
implement the model-based design. In this paper, we
show that the performance gap between the model-level semantics
of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers
and their implementation-level semantics can be rigorously
quantified if the controller implementation is executed on a
predictable time-triggered architecture. Our technical approach
uses lifting techniques for periodic, time-varying linear
systems in order to compute the exact error between
the model semantics and the execution semantics. Explicitly
computing the impact of the implementation on overall
system performance allows us to compare and partially order
different implementations with various scheduling or timing
characteristics.},

Semantic domain based on a complete metric structure.
Argue for a topological approach based on domains of complete metric spaces,
saying that they ``seem a natural method by which to induce a
hierarchy on the various models'' and they ``appear more appropriate
for modelling continuous concepts such as real time.'' To argue for a metric space approach,
they consider the following sequence, which converges in a metric space to P:
 P_0 = {<>, <b>, <bb>, ...}
 P_1 = {<>, <a>, <ab>, <abb>, ...}
 P_2 = {<>, <a>, <aa>, <aab>, <aabb>, ...}
 ...
 P     = {<>, <a>, <aa>, <aaa>, <aaaa>, ...}
These will not converge in a complete partial order structure based on set inclusion for
the trace model.

Time is the non-negative reals, with no lower bound on time intervals.
"Realism" constraint is that a given process should engage in only finitely many
events in a bounded period of time (Zeno). Talks about a "subtle distinction" between
deadlock and divergence, where the latter is where a process goes off and refuses to
engage (e.g., infinite loop). "Recursive processes" are defined as the unique least
fixed point of contraction mappings on a semantic domain structured as a complete metric space
[de Bakker and Zucker, 1982, Golson and Rounds, 1983, Nivat 1979, Roscoe's PhD thesis, Rounds 1985].
Say that "a given recursive process is only ready to engage in an observable event after a
delay of \delta time from making a recursive call."

@techreport{Reekie:92:Thesis,
   author = {Reekie, H. John},
   title = {Toward Effective Programming for Parallel Digital Signal Processing},
   institution = {University of Technology, Sydney},
   note = {Describes extensions and simplifications of Haskell to support parallel DSP. Proposes a ?two-view?, graphical/textual representation, with cross updating. Uses vector and stream dataypes in Haskell to construct process networks. [from johnr@ee.uts.edu.au]: ?I perform [stream] operations in Haskell (a lazy functional programming language). Apart from the sample rate annotations I use in the report, all of the code runs on freely available compilers and interpreters. Examples: Sum two series:
	summer xs ys = maps2 (+) xs ys
Integrator:
	integrate xs = scan (+) 0 xs
Buffer:	slide k xs = scan (<<) (copy k 0) xs
FIR:	fir coeffs xs = maps (ip coeffs) (slide k xs)
I?ve done a little work on representing non-uniformly sampled series, but nothing published yet.?
A graphical syntax is given to the Haskell programs, based on the informal box-and-arrow notation often used in functional programming. A limited number of higher order functions are available (variants of map, scan (apply a function to a vector element and the output of the function applied to the previous vector element), and seq (similar)) to vectors and streams. Good graphical notation is given for these, but each notation is specific to the particular higher order function. Hence, constructing arbitrary higher order functions is not always easy. The authors say that the graphical syntax for these higher order functions makes extesibility limited. For vectors (not streams), there are also variants of fold (reduces a vector to a scalar).
In the higher order functions given, some of the notation supports explicitly showing a function as an input to a process. But usually it is just a notation in the graphic, implying something more like Ptolemy parameters than Ptolemy inputs.
Unfolding is the operation of expanding a function or variable identifier using its definition. Unfolding higher order functions, expanding the recursive definition of mapv, for example, can expose parallelism by replacing the iterative recursion with a highly parallel construct.
Functional code can be translated into imperative code only for functions that always require all their arguments, Reekie says. The method for determining this is called strictness analysis.
Some interesting observations about Haskell and its syntax are given. Complex numbers have real and imaginary parts separated by ?:+?, as in
	exp (x:+y) = (expx * cos y) :+ (expx * sin y)
		where expx = exp x
A type class hierarchy simplified from Haskell is described. For numerics, the basic classes are Eq, Ord, Num, Floating. Eq has tests for equal or not equal. Ord has tests for greater or less than, Num has arithmetic, Floating has sin, cos, division, etc. Bool is a separate type (not part of this hierarchy). Char, Int, Float, and Complex are dervied from appropriate points in the hiearchy. Identifiers can be used for specific type classes, as in the following declaration:
	sin :: Floating a ? a � a
which means, for a in class Floating, sin has type a � a (a mapping).
Some higher order functions for parallel construction are given, like fan, which broadcasts an argument to two functions, or par, which take a tuple and passes one part to one function and the other part to the other function. Vector versions use vectors of identically typed functions. Is this really a good way to express parallelism?
Process networks are classed into static and dynamic. In static networks, all streams are infinite. In dynamic networks, streams can come and go, and hence the structure of the network can change.
There is no compiler yet for real-time execution of Haskell. Reekie has done his experiments using a Haskell interpreter. Notably lacking are any examples with feeback.
Loop fusion is the process of combining two series-connected loops into one. This is described as the program transformation
	map f . map g = map (f . g)
because on the left both functions operate a stream in separate loops, while on the right, the composition function operates on a stream in a single loop. Several examples are given of using loop fusion to improve the efficiency of an implementation. An FFT is the most elaborate example.
A random useful observation: a tail-recursive form (where a recursive function returns what the inside recursive call returns) of the factorial function (cf. [161]) uses an auxiliary function fact1,
	fact n = fact1 n 1 where
		fact1 0 x	= 1
		fact1 n x	= fact1 (n-1) (x*n)},

   note = {I just heard a talk at CODES/ISSS that I think provides what
we need to definitely do schedulability analysis on PTIDES
models.  It was quite a beautiful talk. The approach
was to encode scheduling decisions as boolean formulas
and use a SAT solver to find feasible solutions based
on constraints (such as precedences and contention).
Given a valid schedule, the technique can then check
it against "non-functional" constraints (such as deadlines
at actuators) and reject solutions that don't meet
these constraints. It then uses a learning strategy,
modifying the boolean formulas to exclude the
infeasible solution.

But then this gets really pretty:
Instead of running the SAT solver to completion each
time, the "non-functional" constraints are encoded
as a background theory, and an SMT solver is used
instead. Infeasible solutions are identified earlier
in the process. Interestingly, something like a
deadline at an actuator will not normally be a
monotonic background theory, but in this talk,
the speaker explained how to make a monotonic
version by constraining when to apply the background
theory. In the case of checking a deadline, you wouldn't
check until you had scheduled all the actors upstream
from an actuator. But you don't have to have scheduled
the whole graph.},

   abstract = {Summary:In multiprocessor systems, the traffic on the bus does not solely originate from data transfers due to data dependencies between tasks, but is also affected by memory transfers as result of cache misses. This has a huge impact on worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis and, in general, on the predictability of real-time applications implemented on such systems. As opposed to the WCET analysis performed for a single processor system, where the cache miss penalty is considered constant, in a multiprocessor system each cache miss has a variable penalty, depending on the bus contention. This affects the tasks' WCET which, however, is needed in order to perform system scheduling. At the same time, the WCET depends on the system schedule due to the bus interference. In this paper we present an approach to worst-case execution time analysis and system scheduling for real-time applications implemented on multiprocessor SoC architectures. The emphasis of this paper is on the bus scheduling policy and its optimization, which is of huge importance for the performance of such a predictable multiprocessor application.},

ramifications of potential ?Blue? actions on the environment. The NOEM also supports sensitivity analysis by
identifying possible pressure (leverage) points in support of the Commander that resolves forecasted instabilities, and by
ranking sensitivities in a list for each leverage point and response. The NOEM can be used to assist Decision Makers,
Analysts and Researchers with understanding the inter-workings of a region or nation state, the consequences of
implementing specific policies, and the ability to plug in new operational environment theories/models as they mature.
The NOEM is built upon an open-source, license-free set of capabilities, and aims to provide support for pluggable
modules that make up a given model. The NOEM currently has an extensive number of modules (e.g. economic,
security & social well-being pieces such as critical infrastructure) completed along with a number of tools to exercise
them. The focus this year is on modeling the social and behavioral aspects of a populace within their environment,
primarily the formation of various interest groups, their beliefs, their requirements, their grievances, their affinities, and
the likelihood of a wide range of their actions, depending on their perceived level of security and happiness. As such,
several research efforts are currently underway to model human behavior from a group perspective, in the pursuit of
eventual integration and balance of populace needs/demands within their respective operational environment and the
capacity to meet those demands. In this paper we will provide an overview of the NOEM, the need for and a description
of its main components. We will also provide a detailed discussion of the model and sample use cases.},

preventing cache thrashing implies you have to have separate memories, which reduces the

Argues that for hard real time systems, increase in average case or best case execution times

   note = {This paper apparently inspired Kahn. Functions are trying to approximate results, and if y is a better approximation than x, Scott writes x  y (cf. Kahn?s notion, where this means that x is prefix of y). Here, x and y are data types, members of partially ordered set. Given such ordering, a monotonic function is such that " x,y � D (a data type domain with such a partial order) x  y implies f(x)  f(y).
The least upper bound (l.u.b.) of two elements of D is
x  y, and the greatest lower bound (g.l.b.) is x  y. We define an element ?top?  x, " x � D and ?bottom? ^  x, " x � D. Top and bottom are assumed to be in D, so D is complete partial order (c.p.o.). Scott says x and y are inconsistent if x  y = , and claims this is not the same as them being incomparable, which means x  y and y  x, or unconnected, which means x  y = ^ (there is no overlap of information). (There seems to be no such difference with a Kahn-style partial order, but there is with Scott?s domains, see examples below.)
The l.u.b. of a subset X of D is written  X. This is a limit if X is ordered. A function is continuous if
	f( X) =  {f(x): x � D}
This is comparable to the usual mathematical notion of continuity if X is ordered and the function is monotonic, so these can be interpreted as limits. Fortunately, if it is continuous, then it is monotonic (see ee290T notes for a proof).
Scott gives two other comparison operators (again, for Kahn-style prefix ordering they seem to be equivalent to ). A basis is a ?dense? subset such that all x in D can be expressed as a l.u.b. of subsets of the basis. x is computable if there is an ordered sequence in the basis with l.u.b. x (i.e., there is a sequence of better and better approximations). A data type may have uncoutably many elements of which only a countable subset is computable.
All finite lattices satisfy Scott?s axioms, and hence form valid data types. For the lattice of integers, plus    and ^, the basis is the set itself. For reals, the lattice is the set of closed intervals, plus    and ^, where x  y if the interval y is entirely contained in the interval x (note the ordering). For the ?perfect? reals, all intervals have length zero. For the ?approximate? reals, they have non-zero length, and the basis is the set of intervals with rational endpoints, plus ^. 
Next, Scott considers product spaces (elements of D � D? are pairs from D and D?), sum spaces (elements of D + D? are in one space or the other) and spaces formed by mappings D � D?. The space of finite lists of elements in D is given by
	D* = D0+ D1+ � + Dn + �
Then he defines
	D? = D + (D? )*
which is just like a recursive definition of lists. If x � D? and a � D, then (a,x) is a continuous mapping from D? into itself. Moreover, if x = (a,x), then x is a fixpoint of such a mapping, and the resulting list has structure
	x = (a, (a, (a, � )))
The same concept applies to function spaces. I.e.,
	D = D� D
exists as a domain, however, as long as the above equality is interpreted as an isomorphism. This, Scott claims, gives a methematical basis for the l-calculus.},

There are relay ports (ports of composite actor) and end ports (which are connected to state machines). Ultimately, everything is given by a state machine. An actor can contain at most one state machine, and any number subactors. (Actors are called capsules sometimes). Ports have protocol roles (abstract classes defining behavior, which the port implements). State machines are the usual UML hierarchical state machines. But they somehow also control the subactors of the actor that containes the state machine. The state machine is integrally tied to its container... it cannot be separately reused. The state machines have "chain states" which are "pass through". There is nothing much said about time, except that two time services are provided via ports, time of day and an interval.},

   abstract = {Abstract: The paper describes an algebraic framework for the study of dataflow networks, which form a paradigm for concurrent computation in which a collection of concurrently and asynchronously executing processes communicate by sending messages between ports connected via FIFO message channels. A syntactic dataflow calculus is defined, having two kinds of terms which represent networks and computations, respectively. By imposing suitable equivalences on networks and computations, we obtain the free dataflow algebra, in which the dataflow networks with m input ports and n output ports are regarded as the objects of a category S/sub m//sup n/, and the computations of such networks are represented by the arrows. Functors defined on S/sub m//sup n/ label each computation by the input buffer consumed and the computations buffer produced during that computation, so that each S/sub m//sup n/ is a span in Cat. It is shown that the free dataflow algebra construction underlies a monad in the category of collections S=(S/sub m//sup n/:m,n>or=0) of spans in Cat. The algebras of this monad, called dataflow algebras, have a monoid structure representing parallel composition, and are also equipped with an action of a certain collection of continuous functions, thereby representing the formation of feedback loops. The two structures are related by a distributive law of feedback over parallel composition. We also observe the following connection with the theory of fibrations: if S is a dataflow algebra, then each S/sub m//sup n/ is a split bifibration in Cat.},

   title = {An Introduction to System Level Modeling in {SystemC} 2.0},
   institution = {Open SystemC Initiative},
   note = {SystemC 2.0 is an extension of SystemC 1.0 to support more models of computation by providing a way to create channels, interfaces, and events with semantics different from the basic ones in SystemC 1.0.  A channel is an object that serves as a container for communication and synchronization.  Channels implement one or more interfaces (access methods). An event is a low-level synchronization primitive.  Examples of channels include queues (FITO, LIFO, etc.), semaphores, memories, and busses (both RTL and transaction-based models).  An example is given that implements a length-10 FIFO queue with blocking reads and writes.  The interfaces are defined so that the write interface can reset the channel and the read interface can query for the number of token available. Multiple inheritance is used so that the channel inherits both of these interfaces (note that this would not be necessary in Java, since these are interfaces). Separation of the read and write interfaces is a good idea here (e.g., the reader cannot reset the channel).

Examination of the code reveals that it assumes that all method calls on the channel are synchronized (mutually exclusive).  This is expensive, and probably not really necessary. Synchronization is achieved via a wait() call that extends that in SystemC 1.0 by having any number of arguments. These arguments are either events or signals.  Swan calls this capability "dynamic sensitivity" because it contrasts with that of SystemC 1.0 where the sensitivity of a process (what triggers the return from wait()) is statically specified.  SystemC 2.0 also allows an argument to wait() to be an integer time value. E.g. wait(200, SC_NS) would cause the process to wait for 200 ns.  Also, wait(200, SC_NS, e) would cause the process to wait for event e with a 200 ns timeout.

Events are different from Signals, which are the only synchronization mechanism in SystemC 1.0.  An event does not have a type and does not transmit a value. An event always causes a sensitive process to resume, whereas a signal only causes a sensitive process to resume if the value changes.  Events can be specified to occur some amount of time in the future (or immediately, one delta step in the future, as with signal assigments).

Swan says continuous-time semantics still cannot be constructed in SystemC, but Kahn process networks, SDF, DDF, CSP, and DE can.},

StreamIt 1.0 requires "filters" (actors) to have static input/output rates (SDF).  SDF parameters are set in the init() method. They "plan to support dynamically changing rates in the future."

   journal = {Computer},
   pages = {78-85},
   note = {Kaola is a model and language for components with procedure-call interfaces and a visual syntax with "provides" and "requires" ports ("interfaces") that get connected. The requires ports look like outputs and the provides look like inputs. The compiler produces #define macros to eliminate any overhead due to the indirection in the references between these (called "static binding").

Interfaces are immutable, defined and named and put into an interface repository.

A "configuration" is an interconnection of components plus configuration-specific code in something called a "module". To get hierarchy, the configuration can export its own requires and provides interfaces, and these can be mediated by the module. E.g., the module can translate a particular provided method into a sequence of calls to provided methods of the components (e.g. to intialize all the components). The module is configuration specific, and is not itself a component, so it does not pollute the component library. The module can also provide services that are required by the components.  For example, a component may require values for configuration parameters, and the module can provide those values. Partial evaluation is used to avoid introducing overhead in doing things this way.

Modules are also used to implement primitive components, thus providing the leaf cells of the hierarchy.

Each "requires" interface (output port) must be connected to either a module or a "provides" interface (input port).  A "provides" interface, however, can be connected to zero or more "requires" interfaces. The paper gives an example where components require a particular hardware interface (an I2C bus) that must be provided by a configuration. Operating system and scheduling services also interact with components through requires and provides interfaces.

A limited form of dynamic binding is provided in the form of "switches," which work together with a module to direct procedure calls. These can be used to, at run time, direct a method call to one or another component. Switches can also be used with "diversity interfaces" (see below), in which case, partial evaluation will likely lead to static binding and the elimination of some components from a configuration (components that are not used).

"Diversity" means one definition, multiple products. Koala's features support this well, particularly through its partial evaluation and static binding, which avoid the overhead often incurred by making components flexible. The authors compare the use of "requires" interfaces to property lists in more conventional component architectures with set() and get() methods, and point out that set() and get() make it more difficult to optimize when properties are set at design time. Instead of "providing" interfaces that must be filled in by the configuration (e.g. set()), Koala components have "require" interfaces that the configuration must provide.  These are called "diversity interfaces."

Koala components can "provide" "optional interfaces" (fashioned after COM's query interface mechanism), which are automatically extended with an iPresent function, which the component is required to implement. E.g., the presence of an interface may depend on the hardware configuration. A component may also "require" an "optional interface" (bizarre terminology), in which case the component can query for whether a configuration has a matching "provides" interface.

The hierarchical structure, components with provides and requires interfaces, and bindings concepts come from the ADL Darwin, but the modules and diversity schemes are new.

Jie Liu says:

Actually, TinyOS and thus the nesC language have the notion of
"provides" and "requires" interfaces, where "requires" are
called "uses". Similar semantics of connecting these interface
method are used in nesC. I am curious about how concurrencies
are handled in Koala, if at all. nesC have a mechanism of
posting tasks. TinyGALS, on the other hand, used a more
Ptolematic way: building actors from synchronous components
through semantics conversion at the boundary of a set of
connected synchronous components. Neither nesC nor TinyOS
have sophisticated dynamic binding and compile time
optimization, though. But it would certainly be interesting
to develop some.},

we call the staged event-driven architecture (SEDA). SEDA is intended
to support massive concurrency demands and simplify the construction

network of event-driven stages connected by explicit queues. This architecture
allows services to be well-conditioned to load, preventing
resources from being overcommitted when demand exceeds service capacity.
SEDA makes use of a set of dynamic resource controllers to
keep stages within their operating regime despite large fluctuations in
load. We describe several control mechanisms for automatic tuning
and load conditioning, including thread pool sizing, event batching, and
adaptive load shedding. We present the SEDA design and an implementation
of an Internet services platform based on this architecture. We
evaluate the use of SEDA through two applications: a high-performance
HTTP server and a packet router for the Gnutella peer-to-peer file sharing
network. These results show that SEDA applications exhibit higher
performance than traditional service designs, and are robust to huge
variations in load.},

manage local memory space, i.e. cache or scratchpad memory
(SPM), such that inter-task interference is completely eliminated.
The cost of saving and restoring the local memory state across
context switches is explicitly handled by the preempting task,
rather than being imposed implicitly on preempted tasks. Unlike
earlier attempts to eliminate inter-task interference, Carousel
allows each task to use as much local memory space as it requires,
permitting the approach to scale to large numbers of tasks.
Carousel is experimentally evaluated using a simulator. We
demonstrate that preemption has no effect on task execution
times, and that the Carousel technique compares well to the
conventional approach to handling interference, where worst-case
interference costs are simply added to the worst-case execution
times (WCETs) of lower-priority tasks.},

   note = {1 University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands

Review: This paper addresses a long standing problem with streaming applications represented as task graphs or dataflow models. The problem is that if the modeling language or framework is sufficiently expressive, then bounds on buffers that ensure freedom from deadlock and achievement of required throughput rates become undecidable. The paper uses a skeleton of the H.263 video decoding algorithm to illustrate the problem. This is a well-chosen application, because it is very practical, is often designed using task graphs or dataflow models, it illustrates the problem well, and it is representative of a family of applications with similar structure. The paper defines a constrained subset of dataflow models (or equivalently task graphs) for which the bounded question is decidable, and then develops an analysis algorithm for deciding.

The paper is rather long and not a particularly easy read, although it is very well written. The material is fairly intrinsically complex. However, I feel that the authors have made it more complex than it needs to be by giving a formalism both for task graph representations and dataflow representations. These two are strongly related, and I don't see how the paper benefits by giving both. The distinction seems to be largely a historical artifact, and too much effort in the paper goes into relating the two. I would suggest picking one and just commenting that a similar formalism can be developed using the other. E.g., it would be easy to augment the dataflow model to include those properties that you borrow from the task graphs, but there is no need to give a separate full formalism for task graphs. },

   title = {The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages},
   publisher = {MIT Press},
   address = {Cambridge, MA, USA},
   note = {This book is an excellent, readable introduction to the subject and its arcane notation. It starts with a review of basic set theory, and includes an appendix on incompleteness and undecidability. The book uses heavily a very simple imperative language IMP. In the appendix, the class of recursively enumerable sets is defined as those that are IMP-checkable, meaning that there exists an IMP program that will verify set membership and will terminate whenever applied to a member of the set. In contrast, recursive sets are IMP-decidable, meaning that there is an IMP program that will terminate on any input and give an answer (0 or 1) indicating set membership. It talks about the G�del number of a command, which is its encoding as a number, and gives as an example of a recursively enumerable set the ?self-halting? subset H, which is the set of all command (programs) that terminate when applied to their own G�del number as input. The halting problem is that H is undecidable (not recursive). G�del?s incompleteness theorem is then given; the set of valid assertions is not checkable (not recursively enumerable). This means that there is no program that will always terminate on a valid assertion. The appendix talks about a an IMP command that can simulate any IMP command when given its G�del number as input (called the universal program). It concludes with Matijasevic?s theorem, which states that Hilbert?s 10th problem (pertaining to whether an expression has an integer-vector root) is not decidable. This result is based on the notion of polynomial programming, which can also be invoked to define subclasses of assertions that are decidable (those that omit either the multiplication or addition symbols).

Denotational semantics is explained to be a description of commands as functions mapping a syntax into a function that maps state into state. I.e., if c is a syntax for a command, C[c] (written with peculiar double square brackets) is a denotation, a partial function that maps state into state. Thus, if s is a state, then C[c]s returns a new state. Winskel claims that the notation appears to not be powerful enough for parallelism and fairness (presumably because of its focus on a single global state).
The book explains complete partial orders (cpos), which are partial orders in which every increasing chain has a least upper bound (lub). It defines monotonic and continuous functions. The ?fixed point theorem? says that continuous functions on a cpo with bottom has a least fixed point, and moreover that the fixed point is equal to the lub of the sequence gotten from repeatedly applying the function to bottom.
A different formulation of the same idea uses the notion of a complete lattice, which is a partial order where every subset has a greatest lower bound (glb). It turns out that this is equivalent to requiring that every subset have a lub. The Knaster-Tarski theorem then states that any monotonic function (not necessarily continuous) has a least fixed point, equal to the glb of the set {x | f(x) <= x}. A corrolary is that every monotonic function has a greatest fixed point.

Prefix orders and Scott topologies are dealt with in chapter 8. It defines ?discrete cpos? to be those where the ordering relationship is the identity. It also discusses product cpos.

The core of the book starts with operational semantics and principles of induction. It then gives denotational semantics and axiomatic semantics, and studies G�del?s incompleteness theorem in the context of Hoare rules. It gives an introduction to domain theory, recursion equations, higher types, information systems, and recursive types. 

It concludes with a chapter on nondeterminism and parallelism, which starts with Dijkstra?s guarded commands as a basis, and then develops Hoare?s CSP and Milner?s CCS, which are presented as very closely related. Both are given in terms of labelled transition systems, where the labels can include input/output operations. These are taken as guard to effectively perform the rendezvous that characterizes these two models. Pure CCS is CCS without variables, where an input guard has to match a particular input value.},

   note = {This paper describes CoCo component composition language. Components have ports that represent "shared variables" or "dataflow" (the paper is unclear about which). Components are "active" (with their own thread of control), "passive" (fired by the closest container that is active), or "event components" (fired by an event, such as a timer to keep track of deadlines). Component interfaces have no functions that can be called, but instead "one may think of a component as a piece of functionality that is executed cyclically (passive components) or in response to a certain event (event components)..." But no model of computation is described... presumably the containing active components define this.

Describes "property bundles" (which aggregate semantically related properties).  These include information concerning real-time execution, such as worst case execution time.

The authors say that have "formalized" the execution semantics via Petri nets, but that is not described in this paper.

The Pecos Project (Pervasive Component Systems) ended in 2002, and was a joint European effort including:

ABB: Asea Brown Boveri AG ? Germany 
FZI: Forschungzentrum Informatik an der Universitaet Karlsruhe ? Germany 
OTI: Object Technology International AG ? The Netherlands 
UNIBE: Software Composition Group, University of Bern ? Switzerland

   note = {This paper is perhaps the most mature of the Yates papers. It has the same result as in his thesis, that networks of delta-causal functions are determinate, but instead of formulating a Scott-continuous functional, this paper uses defines a contractive functional on a complete metric space, and then applies Banach?s theorem for contraction mappings to prove that the network functional has a unique fixed point, and that this fixed point is the same network function derived operationally. The network functional is a mapping from one input-output mapping to another. An ordering of functions is given based on the usual functional extension of the prefix order. Each application of the functional yields a better approximation of the ?correct? function (the one that actually described the input/output relationship of the network). Repeated applications of the functional converge on the correct solution, even though the functional is not monotonic (in the prefix order sense, at least). The paper is a nice illustration of how one can apply Banach?s theorem from first principles. For instance, it defines a metric that not only satisfies the triangle inequality, d(a,c) <= d(a,b) + d(b,c), but also satisfies the strong ultrametric inequality, d(a,c) <= max(d(a,b), d(b,c)), for interesting simplifications.
The premise of the paper is that real-time systems require non-monotonic functions.  Good examples are given, including the timed merge.  Of course, this is only non-monotonic in a prefix-order sense.  It seems to me that a different ordering would make it monotonic, but I?m not sure how. Yates models signals much as we do in the tagged signal model, but his tags are metric time. He assumes a minimal delta separation of any two events in a signal (an ?anti-Zeno? condition). He assumes the processes cannot read the time stamps (not sure why this is needed). Every process is delta causal, which he describes using a slicing operator (up to time...).},

We argue that the gap between the model and the implementation can be rigorously quantified leading to predictability if the implementation is viewed as a sequence of control blocks executed in statically allocated time slots on a time-triggered platform. For linear systems controlled by linear controllers, we show how to calculate the exact error between the model-level semantics and the execution semantics of an implementation, allowing us to compare different implementations. The calculated error of different implementations is demonstrated using simulations on illustrative examples},
