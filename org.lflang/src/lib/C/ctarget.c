 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * Target-specific runtime functions for the C target language.
 * This API layer can be used in conjunction with:
 *     target C;
 *
 * Note for target language developers. This is one way of developing a target language where
 * the C core runtime is adopted. This file is a translation layer that implements Lingua Franca
 * APIs which interact with the internal _lf_SET and _lf_schedule APIs. This file can act as a
 * template for future runtime developement for target languages.
 * For source generation, see xtext/org.icyphy.linguafranca/src/org/icyphy/generator/CCppGenerator.xtend.

/**
 * Schedule the specified action with the specified token as a payload.
 * This will trigger an event at a later logical time that depends
 * on whether the action is logical or physical and what its parameter
 * values are.
 *
 * logical action: A logical action has an offset (default is zero)
 * and a minimum interarrival time (MIT), which also defaults to zero.
 * The logical time at which this scheduled event will trigger is
 * the current time plus the offset plus the delay argument given to
 * this function. If, however, that time is not greater than a prior
 * triggering of this logical action by at least the MIT, then the
 * one of two things can happen depending on the policy specified
 * for the action. If the action's policy is DROP (default), then the
 * action is simply dropped and the memory pointed to by value argument
 * is freed. If the policy is DEFER, then the time will be increased
 * to equal the time of the most recent triggering plus the MIT.
 *
 * For the above, "current time" means the logical time of the
 * reaction that is calling this function. Logical actions should
 * always be scheduled within a reaction invocation, never asynchronously
 * from the outside. FIXME: This needs to be checked.
 *
 * physical action: A physical action has all the same parameters
 * as a logical action, but its timestamp will be the larger of the
 * current physical time and the time it would be assigned if it
 * were a logical action.
 *
 * The token is required to be either NULL or a pointer to
 * a token created using create_token().
 *
 * There are three conditions under which this function will not
 * actually put an event on the event queue and decrement the reference count
 * of the token (if there is one), which could result in the payload being
 * freed. In all three cases, this function returns 0. Otherwise,
 * it returns a handle to the scheduled trigger, which is an integer
 * greater than 0.
 *
 * The first condition is that stop() has been called and the time offset
 * of this event is greater than zero.
 * The second condition is that the logical time of the event
 * is greater that the stop time (timeout) that is specified in the target
 * properties or on the command line.
 * The third condition is that the trigger argument is null.
 *
 * @param action The action to be triggered.
 * @param extra_delay Extra offset of the event release above that in the action.
 * @param token The token to carry the payload or null for no payload.
 * @return A handle to the event, or 0 if no event was scheduled, or -1 for error.
