/**
 * This class analyzes the dependencies between reaction runtime instances.
 * For each ReactionInstance, there may be more than one runtime instance because
 * the ReactionInstance may be nested within one or more banks.
 * In the worst case, of these runtime instances may have distinct dependencies,
 * and hence distinct levels in the graph. Moreover, some of these instances
 * may be involved in cycles while others are not.
 * 
 * Upon construction of this class, the runtime instances are created if necessary,
 * stored each ReactionInstance, and assigned levels (maximum number of
 * upstream reaction instances), deadlines, and single dominating reactions.
 * 
 * After creation, the resulting graph will be empty unless there are causality
 * cycles, in which case, the resulting graph is a graph of runtime reaction
 * instances that form cycles.
