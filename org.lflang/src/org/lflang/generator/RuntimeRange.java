/**
 * Class representing a range of runtime instance objects
 * (port channels, reactors, reactions, etc.). This class and its derived classes
 * have the most detailed information about the structure of a Lingua Franca
 * program.  There are three levels of detail:
 * 
 * * The abstract syntax tree (AST).
 * * The compile-time instance graph (CIG).
 * * The runtime instance graph (RIG).
 * 
 * In the AST, each reactor class is represented once.
 * In the CIG, each reactor class is represented as many times as it is
 * instantiated, except that a bank has only one representation (as
 * in the graphical rendition). Equivalently, each CIG node has a unique
 * full name, even though it may represent many runtime instances.
 * The CIG is represented by
 * {@link NamedInstance} and its derived classes.
 * In the RIG, each bank is expanded so each bank member and
 * each port channel is represented.
 * 
 * In general, determining dependencies between reactions requires analysis
 * at the level of the RIG.  But a brute-force representation of the RIG
 * can get very large, and for most programs it has a great deal of
 * redundancy. In a fully detailed representation of the RIG, for example,
 * a bank of width N that contains a bank of width M within which there
 * is a reactor R with port P will have N*M runtime instances of the port.
 * If the port is a multiport with width L, then there are N*M*L
 * edges connected to instances of that port, each of which may go
 * to a distinct set of other remote runtime port instances.
 * 
 * This class and its subclasses give a more compact representation of the
 * RIG in most common cases where collections of runtime instances all have
 * the same dependencies or dependencies form a range that can be represented
 * compactly.
 * 
 * A RuntimeRange represents an adjacent set of RIG objects (port channels, reactions
 * reactors). For example, it can represent port channels 2 through 5 in a multiport
 * of width 10.  The width in this case is 4. If such a port is
 * contained by one or more banks of reactors, then channels 2 through 5
 * of one bank member form a contiguous range. If you want channels 2 through 5
 * of all bank members, then this needs to be represented with multiple ranges.
 * 
 * The maxWidth is the width of the instance multiplied by the widths of
 * each of its containers. For example, if a port of width 4 is contained by
 * a bank of width 2 that is then contained by a bank of width 3, then
 * the maxWidth will be 2*3*4 = 24.
 * 
 * The function iterationOrder returns a list that includes the instance
 * of this range and all its containers, except the top-level reactor (main
 * or federated).  The order of this list is the order in which an
 * iteration over the RIG objects represented by this range should be
 * iterated. If the instance is a PortInstance, then this order will
 * depend on whether connections at any level of the hierarchy are
 * interleaved.
 * 
 * The simplest Ranges are those where the corresponding CIG node represents
 * only one runtime instance (its instance is not (deeply) within a bank 
 * and is not a multiport). In this case, the RuntimeRange and all the objects
 * returned by iterationOrder will have width 1.
 * 
 * In a more complex instance, consider a bank A of width 2 that contains a
 * bank B of width 2 that contains a port instance P with width 2. .
 * There are a total of 8 instances of P, which we can name:
 * 
 *      A0.B0.P0
 *      A0.B0.P1
 *      A0.B1.P0
 *      A0.B1.P1
 *      A1.B0.P0
 *      A1.B0.P1
 *      A1.B1.P0
 *      A1.B1.P1
 * 
 * If there is no interleaving, iterationOrder() returns [P, B, A],
 * indicating that they should be iterated by incrementing the index of P
 * first, then the index of B, then the index of A, as done above.
 * 
 * If the connection within B to port P is interleaved, then the order
 * of iteration order will be [B, P, A], resulting in the list:
 * 
 *      A0.B0.P0
 *      A0.B1.P0
 *      A0.B0.P1
 *      A0.B1.P1
 *      A1.B0.P0
 *      A1.B1.P0
 *      A1.B0.P1
 *      A1.B1.P1
 *      
 *  If the connection within A to B is also interleaved, then the order
 *  will be [A, B, P], resulting in the list:
 *  
 *      A0.B0.P0
 *      A1.B0.P0
 *      A0.B1.P0
 *      A1.B1.P0
 *      A0.B0.P1
 *      A1.B0.P1
 *      A0.B1.P1
 *      A1.B1.P1
 * 
 * Finally, if the connection within A to B is interleaved, but not the
 * connection within B to P, then the order will be [A, P, B], resulting in
 * the list:
 * 
 *      A0.B0.P0
 *      A1.B0.P0
 *      A0.B0.P1
 *      A1.B0.P1
 *      A0.B1.P0
 *      A1.B1.P0
 *      A0.B1.P1
 *      A1.B1.P1
 * 
 * A RuntimeRange is a contiguous subset of one of the above lists, given by
 * a start offset and a width that is less than or equal to maxWidth.
 * 
 * Each element of the above lists can be represented as a permuted mixed-radix (PMR) number,
 * where the low-order digit has radix equal to the width of P, the second digit
 * has radix equal to the width of B, and the final digit has radix equal to the
 * width of A. Each PMR has a permutation vector that defines how to increment
 * PMR number. This permutation vector is derived from the iteration order as
 * follows.  When there is no interleaving, the iteration order is [P, B, A],
 * and the permutation vector is [0, 1, 2].  When there is interleaving, the permutation
 * vector simply specifies the iteration order. For example, if the iteration order
 * is [A, P, B], then the permutation vector is [2, 0, 1], indicating that digit 2
 * of the PMR (corresponding to A) should be incremented first, then digit 0 (for P),
 * then digit 1 (for B).
 * 
 * For a RuntimeRange with width greater than 1,
 * the head() and tail() functions split the range.
 * 
 * This class and subclasses are designed to be immutable.
 * Modifications always return a new RuntimeRange.
