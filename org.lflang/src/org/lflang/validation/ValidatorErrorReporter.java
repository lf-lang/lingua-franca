/**
 * This class translates messages reported via the ErrorReporrter interface to
 * the interface of a given ValidationMessageAcceptor.
 * 
 * Effectively this allows to report errors via the ErrorReporter interface
 * during validator checks, while having the validator still track all the
 * reported warnings and messages. This is required for some functionality, like
 * the construction of an instance graph in LFValidator.checkModel(). Since the
 * instance graph is also used in other components, it does not report directly
 * to the validator, but uses our custom ErrorReporter interface that we use
 * during code generation. This class bridges the gap between the ErrorReporter
 * interface and the messages that the validator expects.
