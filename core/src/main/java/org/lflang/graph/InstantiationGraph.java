/**
 * A graph with vertices that are Reactors (not ReactorInstances) and edges that denote dependencies
 * between them. A "dependency" from reactor class A to reactor class B (A depends on B) means that
 * A instantiates within it at least one instance of B. Note that there a potentially confusing and
 * subtle distinction here between an "instantiation" and an "instance". They are not the same thing
 * at all. An "instantiation" is an AST node representing a statement like {@code a = new A();}.
 * This can result in many instances of reactor class A (if the containing reactor class is
 * instantiated multiple times).
 *
 * <p>In addition to the graph, this class keeps track of the instantiations that induce the
 * dependencies. These can be retrieved using the method {@code getInstantiations(Reactor)}.
