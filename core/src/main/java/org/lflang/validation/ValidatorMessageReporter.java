 * This class translates messages reported via the ErrorReporrter interface to the interface of a
 * given ValidationMessageAcceptor.
 *
 * <p>Effectively this allows to report errors via the ErrorReporter interface during validator
 * checks, while having the validator still track all the reported warnings and messages. This is
 * required for some functionality, like the construction of an instance graph in
 * LFValidator.checkModel(). Since the instance graph is also used in other components, it does not
 * report directly to the validator, but uses our custom ErrorReporter interface that we use during
 * code generation. This class bridges the gap between the ErrorReporter interface and the messages
 * that the validator expects.
