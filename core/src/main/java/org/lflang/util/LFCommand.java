   * <p>This will check first if the command can actually be found and executed. If the command is
   * not found, null is returned. In order to find the command, different methods are applied in the
   * following order:
   *
   * <p>1. Check if the given command {@code cmd} is an executable file within {@code dir}. 2. If
   * the above fails 'which <cmd>' (or 'where <cmd>' on Windows) is executed to see if the command
   * is available on the PATH. 3. If both points above fail, a third attempt is started using bash
   * to indirectly execute the command (see below for an explanation).
   *
   * <p>A bit more context: If the command cannot be found directly, then a second attempt is made
   * using a Bash shell with the --login option, which sources the user's ~/.bash_profile,
   * ~/.bash_login, or ~/.bashrc (whichever is first found) before running the command. This helps
   * to ensure that the user's PATH variable is set according to their usual environment, assuming
   * that they use a bash shell.
   *
   * <p>More information: Unfortunately, at least on a Mac if you are running within Eclipse, the
   * PATH variable is extremely limited; supposedly, it is given by the default provided in
   * /etc/paths, but at least on my machine, it does not even include directories in that file for
   * some reason. One way to add a directory like /usr/local/bin to the path once-and-for-all is
   * this:
   *
   * <p>sudo launchctl config user path /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
   *
   * <p>But asking users to do that is not ideal. Hence, we try a more hack-y approach of just
   * trying to execute using a bash shell. Also note that while ProcessBuilder can be configured to
   * use custom environment variables, these variables do not affect the command that is to be
   * executed but merely the environment in which the command executes.
   *
   * @param cmd The command
   * @param args A list of arguments to pass to the command
   * @param quiet If true, the commands stdout and stderr will be suppressed
