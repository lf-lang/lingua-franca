# Trace sequence diagram visualiser

This is a 1st iteration of a prototyping tool for constructing a sequence diagram 
out of the traces.
It operates over the csv files generated by `trace_to_csv`.

# Running

Once the `.lft` files collected and tranformed into `csv` files, run:
```
$ python3 sd_gen.py -r <rti_trace.csv> -f <fed0_trace.csv> ... <fedn_trace.csv>
```

The output is an html file with the svg in it.

# Current problems

- The collected traces are not complete. They need to be checked for correcteness as well.
- All arrows are horizontal and can be duplicated. Need further processing to derive the connections 
for that.
- The scale needs exploration
