/** This example demonstrates a very simple use of protocol buffers
 *  within a reactor. It encodes and decodes a very simple protocol
 *  buffer definition in Person.proto. This reactor is heavily
 *  based on the examples at https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c/wiki/Examples.
 *  This example just packs and unpacks a message.
 *
 *  To run this example first install the protocol buffers compiler
 *  from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf. It is also
 *  available from homebrew on a Mac via 
 * 
 *       $ brew install protobuf
 * 
 *  Building protobuf from source is slow, so avoid doing that
 *  if possible. Next, install the Google APIs for Python
 *  
 *       $ pip3 install --upgrade google-api-python-client
 *
 *  The code generator assumes
 *  that executables are installed within the PATH. On a Mac, this is
 *  typically at /usr/local/bin.
