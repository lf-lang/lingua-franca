/**
 * Test a sender-receiver network system that relies on microsteps being taken
 * into account. The purpose of this test is to check whether the
 * functionalities pertinent to dynamic STP offset adjustments are present and
 * functioning to a degree.
 *
 * This version of the test does not use a centralized coordinator to advance
 * tag. Therefore, the receiver will rely on an STP offset (initially zero) to
 * wait long enough for messages to arrive before advancing its tag. In this
 * test, the STP offset is initially zero and gradually raised every time an STP
 * violation is perceived until no STP violation is observed. Therefore, the
 * exact outcome of the test will depend on actual runtime timing.
