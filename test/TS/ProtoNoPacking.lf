// FIXME: UPDATE COMMENT BELOW

/** This example creates a Protocol Buffer message and passes it to
 *  another reactor without packing and unpacking. This demonstrates
 *  that local communication, within one shared-memory machine, need
 *  not incur the overhead of packing and unpacking.
 *
 *  To run this example first install the protocol buffers compiler
 *  from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf. It is also
 *  available from homebrew on a Mac via 
 * 
 *       $ brew install protobuf
 * 
 *  Building protobuf from source is slow, so avoid doing that
 *  if possible. Next install the C plugin for protocol buffers from 
 * 
 *      https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c
 * 
 *  The code generator assumes
 *  that executables are installed within the PATH. On a Mac, this is
 *  typically at /usr/local/bin.
