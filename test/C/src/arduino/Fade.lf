/**
 * This example shows how to fade an LED on pin 9 using the analogWrite() function. The
 * analogWrite() function uses PWM, so if you want to change the pin you're using, be sure to use
 * another PWM capable pin. On most Arduino, the PWM pins are identified with a "~" sign, like ~3,
 * ~5, ~6, ~9, ~10 and ~11.
