// Check for speedup of multithreaded execution on multicore machines. Each instance of TakeTime
// takes 200 ms to transport the input to the output. Four of them are instantiated. Note that
// without parallel execution, there is no way this can keep up with real time since in every 200
// msec cycle it has 800 msec of work to do. On a quad-core machine, however, it does pretty well,
// completing 800 msec of work in about 225 msec. See ThreadedMultiport for a parameterized version
// of this.
