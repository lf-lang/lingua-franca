/**
 * This example creates a Protocol Buffer message and passes it to another reactor without packing
 * and unpacking. This demonstrates that local communication, within one shared-memory machine, need
 * not incur the overhead of packing and unpacking.
 *
 * To run this test, first install the protocol buffers compiler from
 * https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf as well as the C plugin which comes from
 * https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c.
 *
 * (Building protobuf from source is slow, so avoid doing that if possible.)
 *
 * On Mac, you can install these dependencies via Homebrew:
 * $ brew install protobuf
 * $ brew install protobuf-c
