/**
 * This tests that the precedence order of reaction invocation is kept in the hierarchy of reactors
 * when a feedback loop is present in decentralized coordination. The STAA is specified only on
 * top-level reactions to the input and is implied for the contained reactor. This shows how to use
 * library reactors with decentralized coordination when you need to specify an STAA.
 *
 * This test is designed to not be flaky. The timing properties are set so that warnings are printed
 * if the execution timing is wildly off, specifically if communication between federates takes more
 * than 100 ms. But the test will not fail in these cases.
