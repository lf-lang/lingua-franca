/**
 * Test a sender-receiver network system that relies on microsteps being taken into account. The
 * purpose of this test is to check whether the functionalities pertinent to dynamic STP offset
 * adjustments are present and functioning to a degree.
 *
 * This version of the test does not use a centralized coordinator to advance the tag. Therefore,
 * the receiver will rely on an STP offset (initially zero) to wait long enough for messages to
 * arrive before advancing its tag. In this test, the STP offset is initially zero and gradually
 * raised every time an STP violation is perceived until no STP violation is observed. Therefore,
 * the exact outcome of the test will depend on actual runtime timing.
