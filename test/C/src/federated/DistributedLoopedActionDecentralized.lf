/**
 * Test a sender-receiver network system that
 * relies on microsteps being taken into account.
 * The purpose of this test is to check whether the functionalities
 * pertinent to dynamic STP offset adjustments are present and
 * functioning to a degree.
 * 
 * This version of the test does not use a centralized
 * coordinator to advance tag. Therefore,
 * the receiver will rely on an STP offset (initially
 * zero) to wait long enough for messages to arrive 
 * before advancing its tag. In this test,
 * the STP offset is initially zero and gradually 
 * raised every time a tardiness is perceived until 
 * no tardiness is observed. Therefore, the exact 
 * outcome of the test will depend on actual runtime
 * timing.
