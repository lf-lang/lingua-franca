/**
 * When there is an output in the federate reactor, the compiler checks if the output is
 * (transitively) connected to a physical action inside the same reactor, as the physical action
 * could result in generating a large number of NULL messages. As the compiler looks for the
 * physical action recursively, it should be able to handle non-trivial "trigger loop" formed by a
 * set of actions. This tests check if the compiler can successfully handle programs with such a
 * pattern without getting stack overflow.
