/**
 * Basic benchmark from the Savina benchmark suite that is intended to measure message-passing
 * overhead.
 *
 * This version is distributed, communicating using logical connections over sockets.
 *
 * See [Benchmarks wiki page](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Benchmarks).
 *
 * This is based on https://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/54 See
 * https://shamsimam.github.io/papers/2014-agere-savina.pdf.
 *
 * This is a distributed version, where Ping and Pong run in separate programs and can be run on
 * different machines.
 *
 * There is no parallelism in this application, so it does not benefit from being being distributed.
