/**
 * Basic benchmark from the Savina benchmark suite that is intended to measure message-passing
 * overhead. This is based on https://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/54 See
 * https://shamsimam.github.io/papers/2014-agere-savina.pdf.
 *
 * Ping introduces a microstep delay using a logical action to break the causality loop.
 *
 * To get a sense, some (informal) results for 1,000,000 ping-pongs on my Mac:
 * - Unthreaded: 97 msec
 * - Threaded: 265 msec
 *
 * There is no parallelism in this application, so it does not benefit from being being threaded,
 * just some additional overhead.
 *
 * These measurements are total execution time, including startup and shutdown. These are about an
 * order of magnitude faster than anything reported in the paper.
