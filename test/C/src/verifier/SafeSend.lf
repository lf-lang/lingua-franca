/**
 * (Original) Description: This example illustrates the "Verify Absence-of-Errors" mode. The server
 * expects a tuple `{REQUEST,PID-OF-SENDER}` but the main sends to it an atom instead of its pid,
 * then generating an exception when the server tries to send back a response to what he assumes to
 * be a pid.
 *
 * The verification step discovers a *genuine* counter-example. To inspect the error trace run bfc
 * on the generated model and look at the trace alongside the dot model of the ACS.
