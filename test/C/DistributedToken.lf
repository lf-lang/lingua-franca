/**
 * Distributed LF program where a MessageGenerator creates a string
 * message that is sent via the RTI (runtime infrastructure) to a
 * receiver that prints the message. The type is char*, so this
 * tests the transport of token-encapsulated messages.
 * Three executable programs are generated, Distributed,
 * Distributed_Sender, and Distributed_Receiver.
 * The RTI is realized in the first of these and is identified
 * as a "launcher," so it launches the other two programs.
 * 
 * This program uses a 'physical' connection ~> with an 'after' that
 * is sufficiently large to get deterministic timestamps. Hence, it
 * realizes a 'poor man's Ptides' that does not require clock synchronization
 * nor HLA-style centralized control over the advancement of time.
