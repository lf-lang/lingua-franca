/**
 * Reactor that subscribes to a specified MQTT topic on which
 * string messages are published.
 * This reactor extracts the sender's timestamp from the message
 * and adds to this timestamp the specified offset. If that
 * offset is larger than the current physical time at which this
 * reactor receives the message, then it assigns that incremented timestamp
 * to the message.  Otherwise, the received message gets a timestamp
 * equal to the physical time at which the message is received.
 * 
 * In addition, if the corresponding MQTTPublisher has its
 * parameter include_physical_timestamp set to non-zero, then
 * this reactor measures the physical transport time from the
 * time of sending (as reported by the physical clock at the sender)
 * and the time at which this reactor's reaction is invoked
 * (as reported by the physical clock at this receiver).
 * 
 * If the offset is always greater than or equal to the sum of
 * transport latency, clock synchronization error, and execution
 * times between creation of the timestamped event at the sender
 * and its reception at the receiver, then the overall program
 * remains deterministic.
 * Hence, a good practice, if the application can tolerate the
 * latency, is to set the offset to be larger than this expected
 * communication latency between a publisher and a subscriber.
 * To determine whether an execution was deterministic in this
 * sense, set include_physical_timestamp = 0 at the sender,
 * set a non-zero offset at the receiver, and see if the reported
 * average latency equals the reported maximum latency. If they
 * are equal, then execution was deterministic.
 * 
 * By default, the offset is 0, so the assigned timestamp will
 * always be the physical time at which the message is received,
 * assuming the clock synchronization error is less than the
 * transport latency. With this setting, this timestamp increment
 * also measures the total communication latency. If the sender has
 * include_physical_timestamp set to zero, then this reactor
 * reports at the end of execution the average and
 * maximum timestamp increments rather than physical latencies.
 * 
 * @param topic The topic name on which to publish.
 * @param address The IP address of the MQTT broker.
 * @param clientID The name of the client instance.
 *  These names are required to be unique.
 * @param offset The offset to add to the sender's timestamp.
 * @see MQTTPublisher.
