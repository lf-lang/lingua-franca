/**
 * Reactor that publishes strings to a specified MQTT topic.
 * This publisher appends to the end of the message the
 * timestamp of the message at the publisher. The receiving
 * end adds to this timestamp a specified offset, and if that
 * offset is larger than the current physical time at which it
 * receives the message, assigns that incremented timestamp
 * to the message.  If the offset is always greater than or
 * equal to the transport latency plus the clock synchronization
 * error, then the overall program remains deterministic.
 * 
 * This publisher also ensures in-order delivery messages to
 * subscribers. If an attempt is made to send a message before
 * the delivery of the previous message has completed, then the reaction
 * that sends the message (the reaction to an input 'in') will
 * block until the previous delivery has completed.
 *
 * @param topic The topic name on which to publish.
 * @param address The IP address of the MQTT broker.
 * @param clientID The name of the client instance.
 *  These names are required to be unique.
 * @param include_physical_timestamp If true, include
 *  in the message the time of the local physical clock
 *  when the message is sent.
 * @see MQTTSubscriber.
