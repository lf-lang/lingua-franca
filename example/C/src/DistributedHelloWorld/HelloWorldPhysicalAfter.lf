/**
 * Version of HelloWorldPhysical that uses a physical connection,
 * indicated by ~>, with an `after` on the connection.
 * 
 * The after value on the connection gives a logical time offset
 * between the sender and the receiver. If the connection were not a physical one,
 * indicated with ~>, then this logical time offset would simply be the logical
 * time offset obtained.  However, since it is a physical one, the offset between
 * the timestamps is the the communication latency plus 10 msec.
