# Double Unlock Key Fob (Digital Twin) Example

This example is similar to the Key Fob Demo, but with 3 states: Locked, Driver's Door Unlocked, and All Doors Unlocked. 
A simulator program `Simulator.lf` is also included to demonstrate generating simulated signals at arbitrary logical time. 

To run the program, do `lfc Simulator.lf` and use the bash scripts to launch each federate in a separate terminal window.
