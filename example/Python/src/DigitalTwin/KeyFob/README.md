# Key Fob (Digital Twin) Example

This example shows two federates, one hosted locally and the other hosted on Google Cloud, interacting via an RTI that is also hosted on Google Cloud.

Check out this (video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7dYKLoHXVE] for a recorded demo. 

## Before we start

Make sure you have a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account and a project set up. 

To set up an account, see here:
https://console.cloud.google.com

To set up a GCP project, see here:
https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects

We will be working with the Google Cloud SDK. For installation instructions, see here:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart#installing_the_latest_version


Mac users can download it using brew.
```bash
user$ brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
```

After downloading the Google Cloud SDK, do the following and follow the [guide](
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) to finish initializing the SDK:

```bash
user$ gcloud init
```


Then, authenticate google cloud for docker:
```bash
user$ gcloud auth login
user$ gcloud auth configure-docker
```

Additionally, export the project ID of the project you want to use for this example:
```bash
user$ gcloud projects list
user$ export PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

For clarity purposes, I will use `user$ ` to denote a local terminal, `user@rti-vm ~ $ ` to denote the terminal RTI VM, and `user@twin-vm ~ $ ` to denote the terminal inside the digital twin VM. 


## Instructions

### Setting up the RTI and the digital twin on the cloud

Run the `setup.sh` script to set up the RTI and the digital twin on the cloud:
```bash
user$ ./scripts/cloud/setup.sh
```

When the script finishes, ssh into the digital twin:
```bash
user$ gcloud compute ssh twin-vm
```

Inside the VM, find the container ID of the digital twin:
```bash
user@twin-vm ~ $ docker container list
```

Attach the digital twin container using the container ID from the previous step:
```bash
user@twin-vm ~ $ docker container attach CONTAINER_ID
```

### Running the local key fob

Open another terminal in the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` is located. Run `run_local_copy.sh` to run the local key fob:
```bash
user$ ./scripts/cloud/run_local_copy.sh
```

Now you should see the key fobs in each terminal syncing with each other through the RTI on the cloud.

### Clean up

Run the clean up script:
```bash
user$ ./scripts/cloud/cleanup.sh
```

### Conclusion

Congrats! You just executed a federated LF program using an RTI hosted on the cloud.
