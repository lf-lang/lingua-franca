This document includes information about supported operating systems and external dependencies that are expected to be manually installed by the user.


## Core Development Requirements

### **Supported Operating Systems**
|         |    OS Version     | C  | C++ | Python | TypeScript |
|---------|-------------------|----|-----|--------|------------|
| Ubuntu  | >= 20.04          | Y  | Y   | Y      | Y          |
| MacOS   | >= 10.15 Catalina | Y  | Y   | Y      | Y          |
| Windows | >= 10 1903        | Y  | Y   | Y      | Y          |

### **Dependencies**
- Java >= 11

In order to develop the core Lingua Franca, the only basic requirement is to have Java >= 11 installed. You should be able to download and run the provided Eclipse development project (see [Downloading and Building](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Downloading-and-Building)). This will get you as far as modifying the under-the-hood code of Lingua Franca, and contributing to the ongoing open-source effort. Please see [Contribution]().

## Target Language Development Requirements
With Java (>= 11), you should also be able to use the provided Eclipse IDE products located at [Releases](). The Eclipse IDE product will give you the ability to write a Lingua Franca program in any of the supported target languages (see [Language-Specification](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Language-Specification)), generate synthesized diagrams for your program (see [Diagrams - installed out of the box](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Diagrams)), and to generate standalone program codes in the specified target language (but no binaries). Any particular plugin or additional dependencies are managed by the Eclipse IDE product itself.

However, to compile the generated code and to create a binary (which is done by default), each target language in Lingua Franca has an additional set of requirements, which are listed in this section. We also include a list of tested operating systems in the format of a compact table below.

**Note:** Compiling the generated code is generally automatically done in the Eclipse IDE or while using the `lfc` command line tool. This default behavior can be disabled, however, using the [no-compile](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/target-specification#no-compile) target property in your Lingua Franca program or by using the `-n` argument for the `lfc` command line tool (see [Command Line Tools](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Command-Line-Tools)).
