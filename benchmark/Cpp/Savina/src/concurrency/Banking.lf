 * 
 * This benchmark consists of a so-called 'Teller' and a number of Account reactors.
 * The Accounts keep an internal balance. The Teller generates a series of random 
 * credit messages which it sends to the various accounts. Each credit message
 * specifies an amount and a destination account. The account that receives a credit
 * message from the teller will reduce its balance by the given amount and sends a 
 * debit message of the same amount to the destination account. The destination 
 * account will then increase its balance accordingly.
 * 
 * Note that the original Akka implementation performs an explicit synchronisation, to
 * ensure that the debit message has been processed by the destination account before
 * replying to the teller that the credit message was processed. This synchronization
 * and reply mechanism is not required in LF, as all messages are processed logically
 * synchronous. The teller can be sure that any credit messages it sends will be 
 * processed before moving to the next tag, and similarly each account can be sure that
 * any debit messages it sends will be processed by the receiving accounts before
 * receiving any new messages.
 * 
 * The initial generation of all the credit messages is an interesting problem in LF.
 * In the Akka implementation, the teller actor will just send `numBankings` randomly 
 * generated messages to the account actors, which then process one message after the 
 * other. However, this is not easily doable in LF, as a port can only hold a single 
 * value. In order to send multiple messages to the same account, the teller needs to
 * use an action and advance in logical time before sending the next message. This is
 * currently implemented such that the Teller creates an initial queue per account
 * which contains all credit messages that should be sent to this account. Then it 
 * schedules it `next` action and the corresponding reaction will send the first 
 * round of messages to the accounts. Then it schedules next again. This continues
 * until all messages are sent.
 * 
 * A potential optimization to the problem described above, would be not to send
 * individual credit messages to the accounts, but instead a list of messages (for
 * instance a std::vector). This could be done in a single logical step and should
 * thus be much faster. However, this is likely an unfair advantage over the Akka 
 * implementation, which also sends all messages individually.
