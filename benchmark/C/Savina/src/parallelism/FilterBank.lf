 * 
 * This benchmark has 8 parallel filters, each of which consists of a
 * pipeline of a delay line, an FIR filter, a peculiar downsampler,
 * another delay line, and another FIR filter.  A Combiner
 * then adds the results from all the filters, which are (oddly) always 0.0.
 * 
 * The Source produces a sawtooth waveform from 0 to 999, then repeating.
 * The delay lines delay their inputs by 16384 samples, so the first
 * 16383 outputs are zero. Actually, since the first output of the Source is 0.0,
 * the first 16384 outputs are zero. The FIR filters each wait for
 * peek_length = 16384 samples before producing any output, and as a
 * consequence, the second FIR filter will only do any work once.
 * Moreover, because of the peculiar SampleFilter, its collected
 * inputs will all be 0.0, so the output will be 0.0.
 * In the first execution of the first FIR filter, all inputs have been 0.0,
 * so the first output will be 0.0. The next 16383 outputs will be zero'd
 * out by the SampleFilter, so the first 16384 inputs to the second delay
 * are also all 0.0. The second FIR filter will only receive 0.0, so its
 * output will be 0.0. The FIR filters have odd arbitrary coefficients,
 * but those don't matter because the data is all 0.0.
 * 
 * For more details on this benchmark, see the Cpp version from which it was derived:
 * https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/blob/master/benchmark/Cpp/Savina/src/parallelism/FilterBank.lf.
