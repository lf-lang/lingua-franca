/**
 * Basic benchmark from the Savina benchmark suite that is
 * intended to measure message-passing overhead.
 * See [Benchmarks wiki page](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Benchmarks).
 * This is based on https://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/54
 * See https://shamsimam.github.io/papers/2014-agere-savina.pdf.
 * 
 * Ping introduces a microstep delay using a logical action
 * to break the causality loop.
 * 
 * To get a sense, some (informal) results for 1,000,000 ping-pongs
 * on my Mac:
 * 
 * Unthreaded: 97 msec
 * Threaded: 265 msec
 * 
 * There is no parallelism in this application, so it does not benefit from being
 * being threaded, just some additional overhead.
 * 
 * These measurements are total execution time, including startup and shutdown.
 * These are about an order of magnitude faster than anything reported in the paper.
